Originally drawn up to regulate the life of his monks, who were all laymen, it has been since followed as a rule or set of precepts applicable to many forms of communal living. Even non-religious people have valued the Rule in the quest to lead a more human and humane form of life.</p><p>The Rule was benevolently patriarchal but also democratic. Written in c. 850 in the Dark Ages this was revolutionary. But Dr Williams shows how there is so much to learn for anyone who lives in any kind of community. The hallmarks of the Rule are stability, obedience, a balance between work and contemplation and how to support the community. There is also useful advice on how to work with difficult tiresome people and the virtues of silence and humility. Benedict was an advocate of calmness and had a great gift for organisation, or what we would now call management. This is the background to Rowan Williams&#x2019;s perceptive and beautifully written book.</p></p><p>Rowan Williams is Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. Formerly he was Archbishop of Canterbury and before that Lady Margaret Professor at Cambridge and Regius Professor at Oxford. He speaks eight languages fluently including his own native Welsh. He is also a published poet. Before marriage and professional life he tried his vocation as a Benedictine monk.</p><h2>The Adventures of Happy Jack (Dover Children&#39;s Thrift Classics)</h2><p>Happy Jack Squirrel fills his days with fun and foolishness &#x2014; even while jealously guarding his winter supply of hickory nuts from his mischief-making cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, and playful Striped Chipmunk.<br>But the bouncing, bushy-tailed creature's days of comfort and security are threatened when he wakes one morning to find his worst dream come true: Shadow the Weasel is close by, and Happy Jack finds himself running for his life, trying every trick he knows to get away from his enemy.<br>With gentle charm and good-natured humor, master storyteller Thornton Burgess once again draws youngsters into the timeless world of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows where young readers learn about nature and are encouraged to love the "lesser folk in fur and feathers."</p><p>Author and conservationist Thornton W. Burgess (1874&#x2013;1965) wrote thousands of animal stories for children, starting with the 1910 publication of <i>Old Mother West Wind.</i> Burgess's tales convey his fascination with wildlife and his concern for nature, teaching gentle lessons about ecology and respect for the environment.<br></p><h2>Peterson Reference Guide To Woodpeckers Of North America (Peterson Reference Guides)</h2><p><b>A complete guide to the natural history, ecology, and conservation of North America&#x2019;s 23 woodpecker species.</b><br><br> From the iconic Woody Woodpecker to the ubiquitous Northern Flicker, woodpeckers have long captivated our attention.

Worshippers of the goddess and those interested in exploring the deeper aspects of their own souls will find this tome deeply informative, but for the neo-pagan committed to learning solitary witchcraft, <i>Witch Alone</i> is a must-read. <i>--P.

I know tomorrow.&#x201d; This inscription in Tutankhamun&#x2019;s tomb summarizes&nbsp;<i>The Fifth Beginning</i>. Here, archaeologist Robert L. Kelly explains how the study of our cultural past can predict the future of humanity.<br> &nbsp;<br> In an eminently readable style, Kelly identifies four key pivot points in the six-million-year history of human development: the emergence of technology, culture, agriculture, and the state. In each example, the author examines the long-term processes that resulted in a definitive<i>, </i>no-turning-back&nbsp;change for the organization of society. Kelly then looks ahead, giving us evidence for what he calls a&nbsp;<i>fifth beginning</i>, one that started about AD 1500. Some might call it &#x201c;globalization,&#x201d; but the author places it in its larger context:&nbsp;a five-thousand-year arms race, capitalism&#x2019;s global reach, and the cultural effects of a worldwide communication network.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kelly predicts that the emergent phenomena of this fifth beginning will include the end of war as a viable way to resolve disputes, the end of capitalism as we know it, the widespread shift toward world citizenship, and the rise of forms of cooperation that will end the near-sacred status of nation-states. It&#x2019;s the end of life as we have known it. However, the author is cautiously optimistic: he dwells not on the coming chaos, but on humanity&#x2019;s great potential.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Fifth Beginning </i>is a benchmark book about where we came from and where we&#x2019;re likely headed. Robert L. Kelly&#x2019;s take on archaeology shows how we humans have repeatedly become something entirely different from what we intended to be. In trying to maintain the&nbsp;status quo,&nbsp;we have inadvertently triggered evolutionary changes that were ultimately transformative (and not in a good way). Kelly sounds a simple wake-up call: this time&#x2014;for the very first time&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all up to us.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Hurst Thomas, American Museum of Natural History<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In our past is our future written. Kelly brings the skills and insights of the archaeologist to the question of how we might survive in a clouded and dangerous future. He takes us on an exuberant tour of the human past and how it has shaped us today, all the way to the &#x2018;fifth beginning.&#x2019; The big one. The one that will decide what becomes of nations, cultures, warfare, capitalism, terrorism, and other aspects of human organization. Wisely, Kelly doesn&#x2019;t predict the future. He unearths and interprets it, illuminating our prospects from the fragments of our past behavior. Anyone who thinks there should be a human future will enjoy his &#x2018;dig.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Julian Cribb, author of <i>The Coming Famine</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kelly&nbsp;gives us an intelligent, thoughtful &#x2018;big history&#x2019; of humanity, a story that begs to be told by an archaeologist. Too often 99 percent of human history&#x2014;known only through archaeology&#x2014;becomes an introductory chapter or a footnote. It&#x2019;s about time an archaeologist produced a volume like this, and&nbsp;Kelly&nbsp;does the job superbly. An important book!&#x201d;&#x2014;Stephen H.

Accompanying this view is the assumption that the ethnic group help unqualified allegiance to the United States. <em>Between Two Empires</em> probes the complexities of prewar Japanese America to show how Japanese in America held an in-between space between the United States and the empire of Japan, between American nationality and Japanese racial identity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Eiichiro Azuma</strong> is an Assistant Professor of History and Asian American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br>"Firmly grounded in empirical evidence and theoretically sophisticated, <em>Between Two Empires</em> tells the complex story of Japanese immigration into the United States within the twin contexts of Japanese and U.S. empire-building and the development of transnational identities among the immigrants themselves. Azuma's prose is fluid; his analysis is supple, nuanced, and elegant. This is an exemplary work of enduring significance."--Sucheng Chan, University of California, Santa Barbara<p></p><br>"[A] wonderfully nuanced account of Japanese-Americans' efforts to find a place for themselves between their ancestral country and their country of residence, often in the face of hostility from both....[A]nyone interested in the genuine complexity of Japanese-American history should take the plunge."--<em>Asahi</em><p></p><br>"While aspiring to a cosmopolitan vision, building bridges across the Pacific, the Japanese in America could not escape the clutching hands of the state--indeed two states. In response to the difficult situation, Japanese immigrants developed alternative narratives of their experiences, but a particularly persistent narrative incorporated the American vocabulary of the frontier, reform, family values, and race purity. With this thorough and sophisticated study, so filled with fascinating data and insights, it is not surprising that transnational history is emerging as an imaginative approach to the history of the modern world."--Akira Iriye, Harvard University<p></p><br></p><h2>Translated Woman: Crossing the Border With Esperanza&#39;s Story</h2><p>The tenth-anniversary edition of this classic book, with a new preface <br><br>Translated Woman tells the story of an unforgettable encounter between Ruth Behar, a Cuban-American feminist anthropologist, and Esperanza Hern�ndez, a Mexican street peddler.<br><br>&#x201c;A brave and unusual work. . . .&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;The Boston Globe<br><br>&#x201c;A stunning critique. . . . Engrossing reading at the hands of a skillful interpreter.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review</p><p>When Cuban American anthropologist Ruth Behar tried to piece together the lives led by women in one Mexican village, she didn't reckon on the stubborn magnetism of Esperanza, who "seemed determined to push her story into my hands and stuff it into my ears, so I could take it back across the border." <i>Translated Woman</i> is a giddy rush of dramatic words from Esperanza herself talking late into the night about the hardships and triumphs of her life. Having barely fled the wrath of her drunken father, she takes up with a philandering wife-beater who keeps her in the Mexican version of purdah, complete with a scolding mother-in-law. Looming starvation and the loss of child after child, which she ascribes to the <i>coraje</i> (rage) her worthless husband riles up in her breast, impels her to leave him. Gradually she carves out enough work as a street peddler to support herself and her children. Great turns of phrase from Behar and Esperanza enliven this unusual account. Skirting volatile feuds between neighbors, Behar worries lest her research get mired in "a nest of old hatreds." Says Esperanza of being penniless, "I almost had to use one hand to cover my front and another hand to cover my back."Ruth Behar, professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan, is author of The Vulnerable Observer (Beacon / 4631-0 / $15.00 pb) and director of the documentary film Adio Kerida.</p><h2>The Young Clementina</h2><p><p><strong>Love, Loss, and Love Again...</strong></p><p>Charlotte Dean enjoys nothing more than the solitude of her London flat and the monotonous days of her work at a travel bookshop.

Would he feel afraid of the world, afraid of the pain awaiting him, afraid of his own inadequacy to deal with his fellow men after his long, long years of solitude? Would he refuse to listen when the world called, when his conscience whispered that his duty lay outside his cell, or would he gird up his loins and go forth, somewhat reluctantly, into the world which had turned its back upon him for twelve years?</p> <p>My mythical hermit is standing at the parting of the ways, and so am I. Two roads are open to me, one lonely but well known, peaceful and uneventful; the other full of dangers and difficulties which I cannot foresee. Do what I like I cannot determine which road to take. There is a fog in my brain which clogs its working and prevents me from weighing the points at issue. I have tried to think out my problem for days-and nights-without getting any nearer a solution of my difficulties. Let me try to write it out for a change.</p> <p>The idea of writing down one's difficulties and perplexities is not a new one. Great men have found it valuable in clearing their minds and helping them to wise and deliberate judgment-why shouldn't I, in my smaller way, find a solution to my difficulties in the same manner? My mind needs clearing, God knows, and if pen and paper will help me to clear it, I shall not grudge the time or the labor involved.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Having got thus far I sat down at my bureau and reached for my pen. Where should I begin? The roots of the matter lay buried thirty years deep-or very nearly so. Should I start in the present and go backward, digging up pieces of the past as I required them, or should I start in the time-honored manner with my birth in Hinkleton Parsonage on a cold, wet, windy night in the autumn of 1895? The first method seemed full of pitfalls, and the second a weariness of the flesh. My soul turned from the labor of writing with sick disgust.</p> <p>And then, quite suddenly, I saw the way to do it-an idea came to me which simplified everything and made the labor of writing a pleasure; and, just as a duster, with a dash of methylated spirit, clears a dusty window, so my view was clarified. One moment the window was obscured and I could not see through it, and the next moment it was crystal clear and I was looking out at the winding paths of my life.</p> <p>The idea which came to me was this, that I should write my whole story for you, and then, since you will never read it, I should read it with your eyes, and give myself your advice. I knew that it would be a pleasure to write for you. I have often wanted to pour my troubles into your sympathetic ear, and here was the opportunity, here was the excuse. The words would flow out of my pen easily, confidently, I need not hesitate to wonder whether you would understand, nor to change a sentence lest you should read it amiss, for you are one of the understanding ones, my dear, and the milk of human kindness is in your heart.</p> <p>You do not remember me, of course-how could you remember-since the only time I ever saw you was three years ago, riding down Piccadilly on the top of a bus. What was there for you to remember-a tall, gawky woman, a woman with long limbs and a lean, tired face? A woman neither young nor old, with gray eyes and crinkly brown hair. She was dressed in a shabby black coat and skirt and a dark red hat of the coal-heaver type, which happened to have just gone out of fashion at the time. Did you see this woman? You looked at her, of course, you smiled at her, you even spoke to her in a curiously deep voice. You thanked the shabby stranger for rescuing a bunch of wild flowers which had fallen under the seat and you said, somewhat apologetically, "I am taking them to a country woman who lives in a basement. She likes country flowers best, you see."</p> <p>There was meadow-sweet in the bunch, and dog-roses, and ox-eye daisies, and a host of other flowers which country children pick in the meadows and the hedges about their homes-country children with rosy faces and tangled hair.</p> <p>I realized at once that you understand things; you were of the understanding kind. You were prosperous, that was obvious from the clothes you wore. (Your coat and skirt of navy blue flannel was plain but well cut, your black hat was perfect in its crisp line, your shoes and stockings, your gloves, your bag, the orange silk scarf twisted carelessly round your neck were all good, carefully chosen, the best of their kind. I noticed the soft wave of your dark hair and the smooth, well-tended texture of your slightly tanned skin). You were prosperous and comfortable, your life was a life of ease, but you still understood the feelings of those less fortunate than yourself, you still cared to understand.</p> <p>How much easier it would have been for you to buy flowers in London for that woman you were going to see-how much easier than picking them yourself in the fields and meadows which lay about your pleasant country home and carrying them up to town in the train and the bus! You didn't do the easier thing; you did the thing that would give the more pleasure. All this flashed through my mind in a moment. Almost before you had finished speaking I saw you in the fields, picking those flowers to take to town for the country woman who lived in a basement. I had settled you in the country in a beautiful house, I had given you a park full of old trees casting grateful shadows on the thick grass, I had given you a rose garden with a sundial, I had given you a husband, horses, cars, dogs.</p> <p>I buried my face in the sweetness of the country flowers before I handed them back to you.</p> <p>"She will love them," I said.</p> <p>"You don't think they will make her homesick?" you asked, raising your dark eyebrows a trifle, and looking at me anxiously out of your night-blue eyes.</p> <p>"They may," I told you. "They have made me homesick, you see. But it was worth it."</p> <p>"Pain is worthwhile sometimes," you said.</p> <p>We looked at each other gravely (I wonder if you remember), I knew that we could become friends-we were friends already, I knew that we could talk to each other about things that mattered, not always agreeing perhaps, but always understanding and appreciating each other's views. I knew that we could be silent together without discomfort, sitting over the fire and dreaming, letting a few words fall and then lapsing into more dreams. I knew-from that little quiver at the corner of your mouth-that we would see the same jokes, the tiny droll incidents which defy you to put them into words so delicate and evanescent they are.</p> <p>Could I ask you your name, or tell you mine? Would you think me mad, a woman you had met for a few moments on the top of a bus, with whom you had exchanged a dozen words? I couldn't do it, of course. I was too shy, too bound by the conventions of the civilized world (were you too shy, or didn't you care?). I was too shy to ask you your name, and so I let you go. You smiled at me as you went. I never saw you again.</p> <p>I never saw you again-what made me write those words? False words they are, false and misleading. You have been with me every day, you have shared all my jokes, you have read with me in the evenings and exchanged thoughts and criticisms. You have walked with me in the park, and had tea with me in my tiny sitting room. We have sat over the fire together talking of the past and surmising about the future. You are my only real friend, you see, the only woman friend I have ever had. I had always longed for a friend, a woman friend of my own generation, wise and witty and tender.</p> <p>Of course I know that you have forgotten me long ago, you are not lonely like I am. You have a husband to share your life, a house to care for, a garden to enjoy, perhaps you have children. You would think it crazy that a woman you met three years ago for ten minutes should think of you as her greatest friend, but you would not grudge me the consolation of your shadowy presence if you knew what it meant to me.</p> <p>Just one thing more before I begin my story-I have always called you Clare. I never knew anybody called Clare, but I love the name and it seemed to suit you. I had to have a name to call you when I needed you. "Clare!" and there you are, sitting in my shabby old chair, smiling at me and waiting for me to begin.</p></p><h2>Rich Dad&#39;s The Business School: For People Who Like Helping People</h2><p>In this second edition of his bestselling book, Robert T.

It is not a mere reorganization of the data into a new kind of library catalogue, nor another specualtive philosophy about the nature of man and language, but rather a rigorus explication of our intuitions about our language in terms of an overt axiom system, the theorems derivable from it, explicit results which may be compared with new data and other intuitions, all based plainly on an overt theory of the internal structure of languages; and it may well provide an opportunity for the application of explicity measures of simplicity to decide preference of one form over another form of grammar.</p><p>Noam Chomsky is Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.David W. Lightfoot is Professor at Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA.</p><h2>The Female Thermometer: Eighteenth-Century Culture and the Invention of the Uncanny (Ideologies of Desire)</h2><p>The work of leading scholar Terry Castle, called by the <em>New York Times</em> "always engaging...consistently fascinating," has helped to revolutionize eighteenth-century studies. <em>The Female Thermometer</em> brings together Castle's essays on the phantasmagoric side of eighteenth-century literature and culture. Taking as her emblem the fanciful "female thermometer," an imaginary instrument invented by eighteenth-century satirists to measure levels of female sexual arousal, Castle explores what she calls the "impinging strangeness" of the eighteenth-century imagination--the ways in which the rationalist imperatives of the age paradoxically worked to produce what Freud would later call the uncanny. In essays on doubling and fantasy in the novels of Defoe and Richardson, sexual impersonators and the dream-like world of the eighteenth-century masquerade, magic-lantern shows, automata, and other surreal inventions of Enlightenment science, and the hallucinatory obsessions of Gothic fiction, Castle offers a haunting portrait of a remarkable epoch. Her collection explores the links between material culture, gender, and the rise of modern forms and formulas of subjectivity, effectively rewriting the cultural history of modern Europe from a materialist and feminist perspective.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terry Castle</strong> is Professor of English at Stanford University. She is the author of <em>The Apparitional Lesbian</em> (1993) and editor of the Oxford's forthcoming <em>The Literature of Lesbianism: A Historical Anthology</em>.<br><br>"<em>The Female Thermometer</em> is filled with incisive observations that make us re-examine the broad preconceptions we hold about the 18th century and reassess some of its specific cultural artifacts."--<em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"Lively new study of 18th-century culture....Intriguing book."--<em>International Herald Tribune</em><p></p><br>"This is an attractive and important book....There is no essay in this book that isn't a pleasure to read, and none that isn't at the same time supported...by extensive and wide-ranging documentation."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"The whole collection is informed not only by Castle's wide-ranging erudition... but by her wit and her persuasive and intriguing interpretations. ...she can always take her argument one step further, adding one more turn to the screw. This is a book to be read by specialists in the different authors--Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Radcliffe--as well as savoured by those interested in eighteenth-century culture and the history of the spectral idea."--<em>Eighteenth-Century Fiction</em><p></p><br>"Terry Castle is well equipped to explore the dark Other of the age of enlightenment, as her book on masquerade demonstrated. Her knowledge of the back alleys and "no trespassing" byways of the culture is minute and particular; and she can not only produce out-of-the-way facts and figures, publications and performances, but she can brilliantly and convincingly articulate their significance for the culture."--ighteenth-Century Fiction<p></p><br></p><h2>5th Grade Jumbo Reading Success Workbook: 3 Books in 1-- Vocabulary Success, Reading Comprehension Success, Writing Success; Activities, Exercises &amp; ...

BOMC.</p><p><b>Douglas Druick</b> is Curator of Prints, Drawings, and European Painting and <b>Peter Kort Zegers</b> is Research Curator at the Art Institute of Chicago. <b>Andreas Bl�hm</b> is Head of Exhibitions and <b>Louis van Tilborgh</b> is Curator of Paintings at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.To accompany the Art Institute of Chicago blockbuster van Gogh and Gauguin exhibit, here's a blockbuster book, with reproductions of such sensuous beauty that they are likely to convert even nonfans of the squabbling yet eternally linked pair. This book's subtitle is a translation of a phrase van Gogh used, more accurately rendered as "The Studio in Southern France," where van Gogh and Gauguin were in close contact, inspiring and antagonizing one another in a way that has fascinated generations of poets, playwrights, screenwriters and even art historians. The most famous van Gogh paintings, like Starry Night and Sunflowers, are put into context here, and there is room also for early, lesser-known works. Four major chapters "Origins," "Encounters," "South Versus North," "The Studio of the South" are followed by a chapter of letters exchanged by the two artists; a "coda" about Gauguin in the tropics, after van Gogh's famous ear-cutting incident broke up their partnership; and a technical appendix with results from lab investigations of canvas fibers and paint chemistry that help to date the works. In clear art historical prose, the painters' motivations are pointed out, such as van Gogh's portrait of Gauguin seen from behind: "In no other instance did Vincent decline to confront a sitter in this way." Two self-portraits, done simultaneously for a friend named Paul Laval, are cogently contrasted, with van Gogh's depiction of his own face showing "a scowl of concern and irritation, his green-eyed gaze skittish..." whereas Gauguin's view of himself shows "watchful, almost smug self-possession." This kind of lively character analysis, as well as art historical smarts, will make this a prestigious title for anyone even vaguely interested in modern French painting, but the 510 illustrations (over 300 in color) are the stars of the show here. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Manhole Covers (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A poetic study of a singular form of urban industrial art and its place in American culture.</b></p><p>They lie underfoot, embellished and gleaming. They seal off and provide entry to an underground world of conduits, water mains, power lines, and sewers. They appear by the thousands in our cities, but very few people ever look at them or think about them as art. At once completely ordinary and totally unexpected, manhole covers present an infinite variety of design in the commonplace as well as a record of defunct utility companies, forgotten business firms, and obsolete foundries. <i>Manhole Covers</i> documents this singular form of urban industrial art and its place in American culture.</p><p>Mimi and Robert Melnick first revealed their obsession with street hardware twenty years ago in a remarkable little book called <i>Manhole Covers of Los Angeles</i> (1974). Printed in a small format and a limited edition, it quickly went out of print and is now a scarce collector's item. But that was just an introduction to their larger project, which has come to fruition in this book of 200 photographs and an extended narrative documenting manhole covers throughout the United States and discussing the history of their use, manufacture, and function.</p><p>A subject that at first seems straightforward and commonplace becomes redolent and poetic in the Melnicks' hands, for their hieroglyphic reading of manhole covers reveals a chapter of urban history that can only be recovered from the logos and markings of these early disks. There are square lids, convex lids, perforated lids. And the older ones wear an astonishingly diverse range of anything-but-blank faces expressed in raised crosses, waffle grids, cut-out diamonds, radial stars, floral patterns, and honeycomb treads. The diversity of design corresponds to an equally diverse typology of form and function, as indicated by their evocative labels: handholes, vents, coalholes, grates, lampholes, storm drains, steam covers, meter lids, traffic buttons.</p></p><p>Mimi Melnick is an urban archaeologist who lives in Encino, California. Her late husband, Robert Melnick, was a photographer who devoted the last ten years of his life to documenting manhole covers all over the world." The Melnicks' work occupies a rather indeterminate genre category: part history of material culture, part exercise in obsessive photographic cataloguing of related objects, part crypto-Pop artist's book. There is a crisp and even elegant matter-of-factness to their writing and their pictures, a spare functionalist precision." -- Allan Sekula<br><br>&amp; quot; The Melnicks' work occupies a rather indeterminate genre category: part history of material culture, part exercise in obsessive photographic cataloguing of related objects, part crypto-Pop artist's book.

Indeed, the years 1880-1900 saw an extraordinary, hothouse flowering of talent, that produced some of the most exotic, stylized, and cerebral literature in the French language. Death and Eros haunt these pages, and a polymorphous perversity by turns hilarious and horrifying. Their stories teem with addicts, maniacs, and murderers as they strive to outdo each other. <br><br>This marvelous selection by Stephen Romer-whose translations brilliantly capture the stylish wit and black humor of the originals--brings together 36 of the best decadent tales from the French fin-de-si�cle, including work by well-known writers such as Maupassant, Lorrain, Mirbeau, and Villiers as well as lesser known figures such as L�on Bloy, Jean Richepin, and the Belgian Georges Rodenbach. Romer's engaging introduction provides a full context for the stories, underscoring the principal literary, philosophical, scientific, and political trends of the time, which fed into their authors' loathing of the modern world, and the discovery of the Unconscious. <br><br>The book also includes biographical notes on the authors and explanatory notes to clarify cultural references, plus a chronology of the key publications and main events of the period.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Napoleon faced the Archduke Charles, the best of the Habsburg commanders, and a reformed Austrian Army that was arguably the best ever fielded by the Danubian Monarchy. The French ultimately triumphed but the margin of superiority was decreasing and all of Napoleon's skill and determination was required to achieve a victorious outcome.<br><br>Gill tackles the political background to the war, especially the motivations that prompted Austria to launch an offensive against France while Napoleon and many of his veterans were distracted in Spain. Though surprised by the timing of the Austrian attack on April 10th, the French Emperor completely reversed a dire strategic situation with stunning blows that he called his 'most brilliant and most skillful maneuvers'. Following a breathless pursuit down the Danube valley, Napoleon occupied the palaces of the Habsburgs for the second time in four years. The Austrians recovered, however, and Napoleon suffered his first unequivocal repulse at the Battle of Aspern-Essling on the shores of the Danube opposite Vienna.<br><br>He would win many battles in his future campaigns, but never again would one of Europe's great powers lie broken at his feet.<br><br>In this respect 1809 represents a high point of the First Empire as well as a watershed, for Napoleon's armies were declining in quality and he was beginning to display the corrosive flaws that contributed to his downfall five years later.</p><p>John H.

His bestselling anthologies, including <i>You Are Being Lied To</i> and <i>Everything You Know Is Wrong,</i> have sold over half a million copies. The New York Times has dubbed Kick "an information archaeologist," Details magazine described Kick as &#x201c;a Renaissance man,&#x201d; and Utne Reader named him one of its &#x201c;50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World.&#x201d; Russ Kick lives and works in Nashville, Tennessee, and Tucson, Arizona.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;The fourth volume of the critically acclaimed "Graphic Canon" series is a high quality, visually stunning collection of more than 40 adapted works that cover a wide range of children's literature illustrated by 21st century artists. Characters such as Alice, Dorothy, Goldilocks, and Harry Potter have a very definite look in our mind thanks to the media. This work transforms familiar and unfamiliar stories by putting them in comic form and reimagining the characters and settings: a rude and grotesquely drawn Alice, the city mouse as a man involved with the Russian mafia, or a young Chinese girl who sneaks into the home of three panda bears. The page layout, medium, and overall style of the art varies greatly, allowing each individual story to make an impression on readers. The versions of the folk- and fairy tales included are the ones that have been watered down for children; additionally, the lengthy size of the book and the analysis at the beginning of each chapter will make it unappealing to casual, child readers. However, this work will make a worthy addition to library collections and will be most appreciated by older teens and adults interested in art, graphic novels as a format, and the deconstruction of stories.

Drawing on key examples and seminal experiments from cell biology, the book demonstrates how quantitative models can help refine our understanding of existing biological data and also be used to make useful predictions. The book blends traditional models in cell biology with the quantitative approach typical in physics, in order to introduce the reader to both the possibilities and boundaries of the emerging field of physical biology. While teaching physical model building in cell biology through a practical, case-study approach, the text explores how quantitative modeling can be used to build a more profound, intuitive understanding of cell biology.</p><p><p><strong>Rob Phillips</strong> is in the Department of Applied Physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Truly a masterpiece! </p> <p><em>Ken Dill, University of California, San Francisco</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall this is a beautiful book. It is idiosyncratic, engaging, fascinating-a book that I actually enjoyed reading. While many textbooks that address aspects of the molecular and cell biology field are essentially dry descriptions of many, many facts (or alleged facts), this book focuses instead on broad principles and underlying unifying themes, describing a much smaller number of systems and phenomena, but with real depth, explaining what we know, how we know it, how to think about it in plain terms, and how it relates to one or more of the broadly applicable principles that the book is really about. This is the kind of book that I would like my students to be learning from- and that I will certainly be treating myself to learning from, repeatedly. </p> <p><em>Jonathan Widom, Northwestern University</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the clear messages of the book is that at least some of the aspects of Biology can be made quantitative. In this sense, I like the idea to present systematically orders of magnitude and the fact that the authors show explicitly experimental results that can be compared quantitatively to the theoretical models presented. This is the classical approach of physicists but many of my biology colleagues do not work this way. In this sense, I think that this book could play a very important role. The book is also well structured with a rigorous outline, a short overview at the beginning of each chapter and a summary of the main points at the end of each chapter. </p> <p><em>Jean-Fran�ois Joanny, Institut Curie</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I really enjoyed reading [Physical Biology of the Cell] tremendously and greatly benefited from it. I loved playing with the simple but very useful estimates spread throughout this book and, most importantly, it made me more optimistic about the role of physics in biology. </p> <p><em>Yitzak Rabin, Bar-llan University</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This book is a monumental intellectual achievement-the authors present a systematic, physical approach to understanding some of the deepest questions in biology. It will become an instant classic and a cornerstone for teaching biophysics. <em>Stephen Quake, Stanford University</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This is simply a wonderful-and totally unique-scientific textbook. The writing style is unlike any other....The authors are speaking directly to the reader. It is a warm and inviting conversation; not a recital of a string-of-factlets. They are conveying their deep respect for all things biological. And making it clear, without any hints of intellectual arrogance, that a true understanding of the cell-any cell-requires a quantitative tack...this is the text that we have been waiting 3 decades for. In short I believe this book, which perhaps could arguably be described as a non-fiction novel as much as a textbook, has within it the power to change the next generation of students. </p> <p><em>Michael Reddy, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was very pleased with the balance of biology and physics. In fact, I think this may be the most important reason why the book worked well for the course I taught last Fall. My students all had engineering backgrounds, and thus came into the class with a very physical mindset, eager to learn something about mechanics and cell biology. And I don&#x2019;t think they were disappointed at all-the book taught us a ton about both. <em>William Klug, University of California, Los Angeles</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This book is an excellent guide to the science making biology quantitative. By bringing together ideas traditionally taught in different disciplines in one resource, it provides a unique perspective on the new biology. A hands-on approach is used throughout to build intuition on both biological processes and the physics behind them. The book is enormously comprehensive and should become a standard for students with a physical sciences background moving into the life sciences and for biologists interested in the quantitative approaches and concepts now changing biology.&nbsp; <em>Peter Swain, McGill University</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>From the South African Past (Sources in Modern History Series)</h2><p>This volume presents primary source materials that illuminate the formation of the modern multiracial society of South Africa.

Intertwining historical, economic, social, cultural, and psychological material and basing her work on a decade of participant observation, the author provides a new understanding of the lives and actions of nonfarm rural poor people and identifies the causes of their marginal situation. Beginning with a typical day in the life of one family, Dr. Fitchen illustrates in specific and personal terms the endemic problems--unsatisfactory employment, low and insecure income, social marginality, inadequate education, neglected health problems, substandard housing, and low self- esteem--that plague rural depressed areas. She describes the ways people perceive their problems and goals, the constraints they face, and the solutions they have developed, looking always for common patterns of thought and action--and an explanation of these patterns--that will be useful to students, practitioners, and policymakers. Among her conclusions are concrete suggestions for breaking the cycle of entrenched rural poverty.</p><p>"Clear and compassionate . . ." -- <i>Rural America</i><br><br>"The picture that emerges here is not pretty: The families are debt-ridden, with little chance of getting out from under; the men are at once docile and angry, the women depressed and often ill. Worse, the children seem doomed to repeat the travails of their parents . . ." -- <i>The New Leader</i><br><br>"The understanding one is able to glean from this work concerning the system of rural poverty serves as a requisite to planners, policymakers, and program developers, as well as front-line workers, clinicians, and community organizers." -- <i>American Journal of Orthopsychiatry</i></p><h2>Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared (New Restored Text Translation)</h2><p><p><strong>Newly restored to the original text: for this new translation, Hofmann returned to Kafka&#x2019;s manuscripts, restoring matters of substance and detail, and even the book&#x2019;s original ending.</strong></p> Michael Hofmann's startlingly visceral and immediate translation revives Kafka's great comedy, and captures a new Kafka, free from Prague and loose in the new world, a Kafka shot through with light in this highly charged and enormously nuanced translation. Kafka began the first of his three novels in 1911, but like the others, <em>Amerika</em> remained unfinished, and perhaps, as Klaus Mann suggested, "necessarily endless." Karl Rossman, the youthful hero of the novel, "a poor boy of seventeen," has been banished by his parents to America, following a scandal. There, with unquenchable optimism, he throws himself into adventure after misadventure, and experiences multiply as he makes his way into the heart of the country, to The Great Nature Theater of Oklahoma. In creating this new translation, Hofmann, as he explains in his introduction, returned to the manuscript version of the book, restoring matters of substance and detail. Fragments which have never before been presented in English are now reinstated including the book's original "ending."<br><br><em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em> said Hofmann&#x2019;s &#x201c;sleek translation does a wonderful job&#x201d; and <em>The New York Times</em> concurred:&nbsp; &#x201c;Anything by Kafka is worth reading again, especially in the hands of such a gifted translator as Hofmann.&#x201d;</p><p><p><strong>Franz Kafka</strong> (1883&#x2013;1924) was one of the most important writers of the twentieth century.

Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s engrossing masterpiece about the dual nature of man&#x2014;and a good doctor whose thirst for knowledge has tragic consequences&#x2014;serves up all the suspense and satisfying chills one expects from the best horror and science fiction. </p></p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Emmy Noether proved her theorem in 1915 and published it in 1918. This profound concept demonstrates the connection between conservation laws and symmetries. For instance, the theorem shows that a system invariant under translations of time, space, or rotation will obey the laws of conservation of energy, linear momentum, or angular momentum, respectively. This exciting result offers a rich unifying principle for all of physics. </p><p>Dwight E. Neuenschwander's introduction to the theorem's genesis, applications, and consequences artfully unpacks its universal importance and unsurpassed elegance. Drawing from over thirty years of teaching the subject, Neuenschwander uses mechanics, optics,geometry, and field theory to point the way to a deep understanding of Noether's Theorem. The three sections provide a step-by-step, simple approach to the less-complex concepts surrounding the theorem, in turn instilling the knowledge and confidence needed to grasp the full wonder it encompasses. Illustrations and worked examples throughout each chapter serve as signposts on the way to this apex of physics. </p><p>Noether's Theorem is an essential principle of post-introductory physics. This handy guide includes end-of-chapter questions for review and appendixes detailing key related physics concepts for further study.</p></p><p><p><b>Dwight E.

He won the Excellence in Undergraduate Physics Teaching Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers.</p><p>"Neuenschwander displays the instincts of a good teacher and writes clearly. Using Noether's Theorem as an overarching principle across areas of theoretical physics, he helps students gain a more integrated picture of what sometimes seem to be independent courses&#x2015;an ever-important thing for undergraduate physics education."</p> (Dr. Cliff Chancey, University of Northern Iowa)<br><br><p>"Neuenschwander writes well and gives thorough explanations."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Without entering into technicalities, the author nevertheless succeeds in preserving a reasonable standard of mathematical rigor and, above all, in convincing the reader of the mathematical beauty and physical relevance of Noether's theorem. If only for that reason, I can strongly recommend this book."</p> (Frans Cantrijn <i>Mathematical Reviews</i>)<br><br><p>"A very readable and concrete introduction to symmetry and invariance in physics with Noether's (first) theorem providing a unifying theme...

Soon, however, there was talk from Chomsky and his associates about plumbing mental structure; then there was a new phonology; and then there was a new set of goals for the field, cutting it off completely from its anthropological roots and hitching it to a new brand of psychology. Rapidly, all of Chomsky's ideas swept the field. While the entrenched linguists were not looking for a messiah, apparently many of their students were. There was a revolution, which colored the field of linguistics for the following decades.<br> Chomsky's assault on Bloomfieldianism (also known as American Structuralism) and his development of Transformational-Generative Grammar was promptly endorsed by new linguistic recruits swelling the discipline in the sixties. Everyone was talking of a scientific revolution in linguistics, and major breakthroughs seemed imminent, but something unexpected happened--Chomsky and his followers had a vehement and public falling out.<br> In <em>The Linguistic Wars</em>, Randy Allen Harris tells how Chomsky began reevaluating the field and rejecting the extensions his students and erstwhile followers were making. Those he rejected (the Generative Semanticists) reacted bitterly, while new students began to pursue Chomsky's updated vision of language. The result was several years of infighting against the backdrop of the notoriously prickly sixties. <br> The outcome of the dispute, Harris shows, was not simply a matter of a good theory beating out a bad one. The debates followed the usual trajectory of most large-scale clashes, scientific or otherwise. Both positions changed dramatically in the course of the dispute--the triumphant Chomskyan position was very different from the initial one; the defeated generative semantics position was even more transformed. Interestingly, important features of generative semantics have since made their way into other linguistic approaches and continue to influence linguistics to this very day. And fairly high up on the list of borrowers is Noam Chomsky himself.<br> The repercussions of the Linguistics Wars are still with us, not only in the bruised feelings and late-night war stories of the combatants, and in the contentious mood in many quarters, but in the way linguists currently look at language and the mind. Full of anecdotes and colorful portraits of key personalities, <em>The Linguistics Wars</em> is a riveting narrative of the course of an important intellectual controversy, and a revealing look into how scientists and scholars contend for theoretical glory.</p><p>When it was first published in 1957, Noam Chomsky&#39;s Syntactic Structures seemed to be just a logical expansion of the reigning approach to linguistics.

In this volume, twenty classic essays, beginning with a piece by Jacob Grimm, reveal the evolving theoretical underpinnings of folkloristics from its nineteenth century origins to its academic comingofage in the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Alan Dundes</b> is known as one of the world's leading authorities on folklore. In more than 30 books he has unveiled the meanings in the oral traditions of many cultures. His most recent book is <i>Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore</i> (Rowman &amp; Littlefield,1999). He lives in Berkeley, where he is professor of anthropology and folklore at the University of California.Alan Dundes, one of the world's leading folklorists, extracts the ground-breaking work of scholars from folklore's earliest days. This collection is recommended. (<i>Nothern Earth</i>)<br><br>Alan Dundes' superb source book provides material evidence for the long standing and deeply committed scholarly interest in the vernacular expressions commonly referred to as folklore. The often unusual selections range from letters to seminal early articles by scholars in philology, literature, music and psychology&#x2015;all of whom shared a commitment to folk expressions. The work is of immediate relevance to students of folklore and will serve as a wonderful teaching tool. Anthropologists, historians of science, and scholars within the cultural studies field in general will be equally interested in this work as it offers an instructive view of disciplinary emergence. Dundes' headnotes to each selection are a tour de force coupling individual biographies and disciplinary history. (Regina Bendix, University of Pennsylvania)<br><br>In this brilliant volume Alan Dundes . . . has taken stock of folkloristic scholarship . . . . Most choices are undisputed, some may be surprising, others are true discoveries and revelations; but in each case Dundes offers deep insights into the workings of folklore and folkloristics and at the same time contributes to 19th and 20th century European and North American intellectual history in the best sense. The volume convincingly portrays and extends folkloristics and will certainly become one of its standard books. (Klaus Roth, Munich University)<br><br>When the discipline of folklore was achieving its first maturity in the United States, Alan Dundes edited an anthology that gave the profession momentum and purposes. Now in its moment of midlife crisis, Alan Dundes again provides order and direction for the folklorists' craft. His new anthology, a collection of key texts, brilliantly introduced, will become the basic historical textbook for the folklorist. It is a generous gift, a welcome and necessary foundation for thought and action. (Henry Glassie, College Professor of Folklore, Indiana University)<br><br>Dundes provides an outstanding source book that highlights major thoeries, methods and concepts in the history of folklore, founded upon as he writes 'filedwork in the library'. The twenty chapters highlight work and personae of the most important folklorists. (Herman Tak, Universiteit Utrecht <i>Focaal No.35, 2000</i>)<br><br>Alan Dundes highlights major theories, methods, and concepts in the history of folklore. These essays, some recovered treasures making their first appearance in English, others already established classics, are intellectual milestones in a disciplinary attempt to put some of the central ideas that shaped our history in the past two hundred years to a scientific and systematic test. Dundes' biographical, bibliographical, and theoretical introductory comments make this anthology an essential text in any introductory course in folklore and more specifically in a course on the history of folklore studies. (Dan Ben-Amos, University of Pennsylvania; editor of Folktales of the Jews)<br><br>Alan Dundes has edited an important book, which will solidly confirm the significance of international folkloristics as an independent, worldwide, scholarly academic discipline. Alan Dundes's collection is a delight in its variety and yet is well held together by the erudition and skilled commentaries of the editor. It is an excellent introduction to folklore and folkloristics and their history. It is truly a work of international folkloristics. (<i>The Folklore Society</i>)<br><br><i>International Folkloristics</i> belongs on every folklorist's shelf and every M.A. reading list. (<i>Missouri Folklore Society Journal</i>)<br><br>Dundes's anthology is a great reference source, especially for folklorists in countries such as Vietnam. This anthology is also a good source for people who intend to write books on international folklore in their own languages. Anyone planning such a project will find suggestions for further reading in the history of folkloristics at the end of Dundes's book. A book that can be used as a practical reference for the teaching and studying of theories, fields, and genres of folklore. (<i>Asian Folklore Studies</i>)<br><br>A number of the pieces in this volume are by authors better known for the books&#x2015;-or volumes of books&#x2015;-they published, such as James Frazer. In addition, the international scope of folklore studies is highlighted with selections by such European heavy-weights as Guiseppe Pitre, one of the most prolific scholars in the field. This makes the volume a one-stop destination for an easily digestible overview of a number of the big figures and big ideas in folklore studies into the 1960s&#x2015;and, conveniently enough, the work is all in English. Prefacing each piece in the volume is an intensive introduction with accompanying suggested further readings. The editor's introductions provide ample contextualization for each piece, while the suggested readings offer a springboard for more in-depth consideration. The introductions accomplish three things: they provide a brief biography and historical background of the scholar; present the historical and current significance of the scholar's ideas; and provide related bibliographical references, past and present. The introductions in conjunction with the selections provide a richly condensed overview of the forces that led to the formation and solidification of the field of folklore studies: a complex amalgamation of intellectual insights,dedicated fieldwork, personality traits, and historical circumstances.

M. Forster recognition as a major writer. Soon to be a limited series on Starz.<br><br>At its heart lie two families&#x2014;the wealthy and business-minded Wilcoxes and the cultured and idealistic Schlegels. When the beautiful and independent Helen Schlegel begins an impetuous affair with the ardent Paul Wilcox, a series of events is sparked&#x2014;some very funny, some very tragic&#x2014;that results in a dispute over who will inherit Howards End, the Wilcoxes' charming country home.&nbsp;<br><br>As much about the clash between individual wills as the clash between the sexes and the classes,&nbsp;<i>Howards End</i>&nbsp;is a novel whose central tenet, "Only connect," remains a powerful prescription for modern life.</p><p>Margaret Schlegel, engaged to the much older, widowed Henry Wilcox, meets her intended the morning after accepting his proposal and realizes that he is a man who has lived without introspection or true self-knowledge. As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Backwoods and Along the Seashore (Shambhala Pocket Classics)</h2><p>The craft and insight that have made <i>Walden</i> one of the best-loved classics of American literature are also found in Henry David Thoreau's other writings. Here, in selections from two of his lesser-known gems, <i>The Maine Woods </i> and <i>Cape Cod </i>, are some of Thoreau's most inspired reflections on the natural world and our relationship to it. Included is Thoreau's record of his climb up Mount Katahdin, his arduous journey by canoe down the Allegash River, the deadly shipwreck he encountered on his first trip to Cape Cod&#x2014;which was then a wild and sparsely populated place&#x2014;and his wonderfully colorful and humorous portrait of a Wellfleet oysterman.</p><p>Henry David Thoreau (1817&#x2013;1862) is one of the most beloved figures in American literature.

But as Kevin M. Levin argues in this carefully researched book, such claims would have shocked anyone who served in the army during the war itself. Levin explains that imprecise contemporary accounts, poorly understood primary-source material, and other misrepresentations helped fuel the rise of the black Confederate myth. Moreover, Levin shows that belief in the existence of black Confederate soldiers largely originated in the 1970s, a period that witnessed both a significant shift in how Americans remembered the Civil War and a rising backlash against African Americans' gains in civil rights and other realms.<br><br>Levin also investigates the roles that African Americans actually performed in the Confederate army, including personal body servants and forced laborers. He demonstrates that regardless of the dangers these men faced in camp, on the march, and on the battlefield, their legal status remained unchanged. Even long after the guns fell silent, Confederate veterans and other writers remembered these men as former slaves and not as soldiers, an important reminder that how the war is remembered often runs counter to history.<br><br></p><p>Kevin M. Levin is a historian and educator based in Boston. He is author of <i>Remembering the Battle of the Crater: War as Murder</i> and the award-winning blog <i>Civil War Memory</i> (cwmemory.com).When parents discover that their schoolchildren are learning about black Confederates, when visitors read a display at a historic site that celebrates black Confederates, and when undergraduates encounter hagiographies of black Confederates online, they will now have a rigorous and trustworthy resource at their disposal to dismantle this dangerous and corrosive distortion of history.--W. Fitzhugh Brundage, author of <i>Civil Torture: An American Tradition</i>, a Pulitzer Prize finalist<br>The pose one sees in photographs of Confederate soldiers with their seemingly loyal 'camp slaves' is in microcosm what the issue of 'black Confederates' became in our own time--a 'pose' by neo-Confederates seeking legitimacy for their fool's cause. Kevin Levin has provided this mythic problem what it dearly needs: a carefully researched and beautifully written history, first of wartime itself, then of the Lost Cause memorial period, and then of the Civil War sesquicentennial in which the question of blacks in gray would not die. Levin's book needs to be widely read as a rich history drawing the life out of a lethal narrative of wish fulfillment.--David W.

It seeks to develop proficiency in basic discrete math problem solving in the way that a calculus textbook develops proficiency in basic analysis problem solving. <p>The three principle aspects of combinatorical reasoning emphasized in this book are: the systematic analysis of different possibilities, the exploration of the logical structure of a problem (e.g. finding manageable subpieces or first solving the problem with three objects instead of n), and ingenuity. Although important uses of combinatorics in computer science, operations research, and finite probability are mentioned, these applications are often used solely for motivation. Numerical examples involving the same concepts use more interesting settings such as poker probabilities or logical games.</p> <p>This book is designed for use by students with a wide range of ability and maturity (sophomores through beginning graduate students). The stronger the students, the harder the exercises that can be assigned. The book can be used for one-quarter, two-quarter, or one-semester course depending on how much material is used.</p></p><p><b>Alan Tucker</b> is Deputy Department Chair and Undergraduate Program Director in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at SUNY Stony Brook."...a well-structured text that addresses a broad range of topics...

The majority of these stunningly sophisticated works of art--among the most unusual and spectacular produced anywhere in the ancient world--all come from a startling archaeological discovery made just fourteen years ago at the previously unknown site of Sanxingdui in Sichuan province. The discovery of this Bronze Age civilization fundamentally changes our understanding of Chinese history.</p><br><p> Representing fifteen hundred years of cultural production, these striking objects are extraordinarily varied, ranging from a monumental standing figure and an almost life-size bronze horse to ritual vessels, masks, and bronze heads of fantastic-looking supernatural beings, finely honed jade knives and ritual blades, and marvelous clay statuettes. Most have never before been seen in the United States. The exhibition and catalogue represent a unique international effort to continue the study of ancient Sichuan.</p><br><p> Under the leadership of Robert Bagley, an international team of scholars contributes eight essays on the archaeological discoveries at Sanxingdui, the art historical importance of these objects, and the new history of ancient China they tell. Contributors are Mich�le Pirazzoli-t'Serstevens, Jessica Rawson, Lothar von Falkenhausen, Alain Thote, Jenny F. So, Michael Nylan, and the Seattle Art Museum's Curator of Chinese Art, Jay Xu. In addition to the essays, there are individual entries for each object, nearly all of which have been newly photographed for this publication.</p><br><p> Ancient Sichuan contributes to a revolutionary change in perceptions of ancient Chinese civilization, providing an unprecedented opportunity to explore the art, material culture, and spiritual life of ancient China.</p><br><p> EXHIBITION SCHEDULE:</p><br><p> Seattle Art Museum, Seattle<br> May-August 2001</p><br><p> Kimbell Museum of Art, Fort Worth<br> September 2001-January 2002</p><br><p> Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York<br> March-June 2002</p><br><p> Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto<br> August-November 2002</p></p><p><i>Ancient Sichuan</i> is the catalog of a spectacular exhibition organized by the Seattle Art Museum. Recent discoveries from Sichuan Province are revolutionizing the history of ancient China, showing that the traditional cradle of Chinese culture, along the Yellow River, had sophisticated competition from distant regions 3,000 years ago. Stately bronze trees and huge bronze heads--some with gold-foil masks, some with strange alien eyes on foot-long stalks--are the centerpieces of the show. Dating from the 12th century B.C., these exotic objects, found with elephant tusks and ritual jade weapons in two vast sacrificial pits, are artifacts of a previously unknown culture whose existence took archaeologists by surprise. These pieces alone would be sufficient for a groundbreaking exhibition, but the show and this beautifully designed catalog take the distinctive nature of local Sichuan culture into Han times, 1,000 years later. Lively ceramic sculptures of entertainers and erotic scenes on wall tiles demonstrate the creativity and exuberance of ancient Sichuan society. Essays by leading scholars in the field compellingly describe the context and significance of the often breathtaking objects. A wealth of comparative material, photographs, and drawings explains how original and different Sichuan culture was from what has long been considered the Yellow River Bronze Age mainstream. With the finds illustrated in <i>Ancient Sichuan</i>, the cradle of Chinese civilization begins to look like a large double bed. <i>--John Stevenson</i><b>Robert Bagley</b> is Professor of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University.

Starting from Plato&#x2019;s fateful division of the world into spirit and matter, her analysis of how patriarchal Western philosophy and religion have used language and science to bolster their power over both women and nature is brilliant and persuasive, coming alive in poetic prose.<br><br>Griffin draws on an astonishing range of sourcesfrom timbering manuals to medical texts to Scripture and classical literaturein showing how destructive has been the impulse to disembody the human soul, and how the long separated might once more be rejoined. Poet Adrienne Rich calls Woman and Nature perhaps the most extraordinary nonfiction work to have merged from the matrix of contemporary female consciousnessa fusion of patriarchal science, ecology, female history and feminism, written by a poet who has created a new form for her vision The book has the impact of a great film or a fresco; yet it is intimately personal, touching to the quick of woman&#x2019;s experience.&#x201d;</p><p>"<b>Woman and Nature</b> is about memory and mutilation, female anger as power, female presence as transforming force. . . .

Underlining the importance of critical thinking in all matters numerical, Best illustrates his points with examples of good and bad statistics about such contemporary concerns as school shootings, fatal hospital errors, bullying, teen suicides, deaths at the World Trade Center, college ratings, the risks of divorce, racial profiling, and fatalities caused by falling coconuts. <i>More Damned Lies and Statistics </i>encourages all of us to think in a more sophisticated and skeptical manner about how statistics are used to promote causes, create fear, and advance particular points of view. <br><br>Best identifies different sorts of numbers that shape how we think about public issues: <i>missing numbers</i> are relevant but overlooked; <i>confusing numbers</i> bewilder when they should inform; <i>scary numbers</i> play to our fears about the present and the future; <i>authoritative numbers</i> demand respect they don&#x2019;t deserve; <i>magical numbers</i> promise unrealistic, simple solutions to complex problems; and <i>contentious numbers</i> become the focus of data duels and stat wars. The author's use of pertinent, socially important examples documents the life-altering consequences of understanding or misunderstanding statistical information. He demystifies statistical measures by explaining in straightforward prose how decisions are made about what to count and what not to count, what assumptions get made, and which figures are brought to our attention. <br><br>Best identifies different sorts of numbers that shape how we think about public issues. Entertaining, enlightening, and very timely, this book offers a basis for critical thinking about the numbers we encounter and a reminder that when it comes to the news, people count&#x2015;in more ways than one.</p><p>"Through his devastating work on common myths about social problems, Joel Best has established himself as a brilliant observer of our national fads and scares. In this latest book, Best confronts yet more of the pseudo-statistics by which we are bamboozled day by day. One obvious question comes to mind. If he can deal with highly significant topics in such lucid and enjoyable prose, why can't other social scientists begin to match him?"&#x2015;Philip Jenkins, author of <i>The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice</i><br><br>"Joel Best continues to confront us with the delicious lunacy of statistical gaffes and fantasies. Whether discussing 'deaths from falling coconuts,' teenage bullying, or likelihood of contracting breast cancer, Best teaches us to avoid the dangers of statistical illiteracy. As his cogent and comic examples from the media amply demonstrate, there is much teaching yet to be done. While we like to believe that it is our opponents who are fools with figures, this volume demonstrates that liberals, conservatives, libertarians, lawyers, physicians, and educators fall in the same numerical traps."&#x2015;Gary Alan Fine, co-author of <i>Whispers on the Color Line: Rumor and Race in America</i><br><br>"Best provides us with another telling compendium of misleading statistics about a variety of topical issues. His approach to explicating them is lucid, instructive, and quite engaging."&#x2015;John Allen Paulos, author of <i>Innumeracy </i><b>Joel Best</b> is Professor and Chair of Sociology and Criminal Justice at the University of Delaware.

This book accompanies an exhibition of 74 paintings and 8 drawings that embody the core of the two artists&#39; collaboration and explores their artistic relationship in detail. Their dynamic interaction began with their first meeting at the Academie Suisse, Paris, circa 1861, and continued through much of their careers. To examine the techniques that Cazanne and Pissarro adopted in response to each other&#39;s work, the exhibition and book juxtapose related works by both artists, reuniting many of them for the first time since they were created. The friendship between Cazanne and Pissarro was of considerable importance within the development of early modernism. An essay by Joachim Pissarro discusses this fascinating interchange and offers new insights into both the shared and the distinctive elements of the two artists&#39; aesthetic sensibility.</p><p>Joachim Pissarro, great-grandson of Camille Pissarro, is a curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.</p><h2>Facing the Ocean: The Atlantic and Its Peoples 8000 BC-AD 1500</h2><p>The Bretons are not French, the Celts are not English, and the Galicians are not Spanish, writes Barry Cunliffe. These maritime communities have long looked north and south along the coast, not inland, to claim a common bond. Even today, the Bretons see themselves as distinct from the French, but refer to the Irish, Welsh, and Galicians as their brothers and cousins.<br> In <em>Facing the Ocean</em>, Barry Cunliffe, one of the world's most highly regarded authorities on prehistoric Europe, offers an utterly original way of looking at that continent. He argues that the peoples of the Atlantic rim--of Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, Brittany, Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar--all share a cultural identity shaped by the Atlantic Ocean, an identity which stretches back almost ten thousand years. These peoples lived at the edge of the world, in places called Land's End, Finistere, and Finisterra, and looked out on a bountiful but terrifying expanse of ocean, a roiling, merciless infinity beyond which there was nothing. Their profound relationship with the ocean set these communities apart from their inland countryman, creating a distinct Atlantic culture. Cunliffe culls the archaeological evidence to illuminate the bonds that developed and intensified between these isolated communities and helped to maintain a shared and distinctive Atlantic identity.<br> Attractively designed and vibrantly written, <em>Facing the Ocean</em> offers a striking reassessment of a people who have usually been regarded as peripheral to European history. It will send shock waves through the history world and will radically change our view of the European past.</p><p><br><strong>Barry Cunliffe</strong> is Professor of European Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, Oxford University. He is the author of numerous books on prehistory, including <em>The Ancient Celts</em> and <em>The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe</em>.<br><br>"An eagle-eye view of unique clarity from an impassioned observer with a discerning mind.... It delivers history from a fresh perspective, encompassing a region rarely glimpsed as a whole."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"Lavishly illustrated...a beautiful book...Cunliffe is to be complimented because he has stepped beyond the yearning for Celtic myths to use contemporary archaeology to tell a great story of human endeavour."--Richard Hodges, <em>History Today</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Historical Atlas of East Central Europe (A History of East Central Europe, Vol 1)</h2><p>For the first time in any language, here is an atlas that covers all of East Central Europe, from the early fifth century through 1992. The atlas encompasses the countries of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece. Also included are the eastern part of Germany (historic Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Prussia, Saxony, and Lusatia), Bavaria, Austria, northeastern Italy (historic Venetia), the lands of historic Poland-Lithuania (present-day Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine up to the Dnieper River), Moldova, and western Turkey.</p><p>Paul Robert Magocsi is professor of history and political science at the University of Toronto.Much in the news recently for radical political and social changes, East Central Europe has known tumult and change for centuries. The stasis the Cold War brought to borders and political systems was an uncharacteristic period of calm. This atlas, the keystone volume in an ongoing 10-volume scholarly history of the region, charts and summarizes changes from the fifth century through 1992.<p>For the purposes of this atlas, the limits of East Central Europe have been defined as "toward the west, the eastern part of Germany (historic Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Prussia, Saxony, and Lusatia), Bavaria, Austria, and northeastern Italy (historic Venetia), and toward the east, the lands of historic Poland-Lithuania (present-day Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine up to the Dnieper River), Moldova, and western Anatolia in Turkey." Nothing is simple in this region, including place-names. As postwar treaties have moved borders back and forth, and as kingdoms, empires, and republics have risen and fallen, place-names have changed depending upon which group held power at a given time. The editors have settled on the principle of using the same name for a town or city on every map regardless of usage at the time depicted on the map or latter-day revisionist desires. The name used is based on present-day political boundaries. This is supplemented by providing "in parentheses below the main entry, as many alternate historical names as space would allow."</p><p>The 89 color maps are arranged in chronological order. Scales vary, but most maps show East Central Europe whole or a substantial portion of it. Legends appropriate to each map are clearly labeled, as are the maps themselves. Substantial interpretive text--a full page or more--accompanies each map. The text enjoys the same clarity as the map it explains. Useful tables (e.g., dates various states declared war on each other from 1914 to 1917, the ethnolinguistic-national composition of Yugoslavia) are imbedded in the text. In addition to showing the state of the entire region at key points in its history, the maps depict religious trends, wars, migrations, population levels, economic developments, and individual countries. Sources for each map are listed in an appendix. They are cited by a section letter and author's name, which refer to items in the extensive four-part bibliography that follows.</p><p>All of this information is accessible through a detailed table of contents and a thorough index that cites places, peoples, events, and topics and differentiates between references to text and maps. Bracketed abbreviations follow many place-names in the index to indicate which of 26 languages they derive from.</p><p>No comparable source in English exists. Adams's <i>Atlas of Russian and East European History</i> (Praeger, 1966) focuses on Russia. Furthermore, it necessarily misses recent developments, and its black-and-white maps are rudimentary in comparison. The <i>Historical Atlas of East Central Europe</i> is, of course, indispensable in libraries that have been collecting the other volumes in the History of East Central Europe series, and it will be a worthy addition to other libraries, especially since interest in this volatile region has expanded well beyond academe. <i></i></p></p><h2>The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought</h2><p>A lively and accessible history of Modernism, <i>The First Moderns</i> is filled with portraits of genius, and intellectual breakthroughs, that richly evoke the <i>fin-de-si�cle</i> atmosphere of Paris, Vienna, St. Louis, and St. Petersburg.

S. Eliot, Max Planck, and Georges Serault with such a lively eye for detail, irony, and ambiance that you feel as if you're reliving those miraculous years."&#x2014;Jon Spayde, <i>Utne Reader</i><br><br></p><p>Everdell (The End of Kings, 1983) presents one of the more accessible studies of early Modernism (up to WW I), relying on a ``big name'' approach to dissect the meanings of one of the most slippery terms in all of cultural criticism. Using geographical benchmarks to elaborate on the subject of Modernism, Everdell first presents imperial Vienna, then Paris, and finally St. Louis as examples of Modernist trends precipitating, emerging, and evolving. Dismissing Virginia Woolf's assertion that the Modern era began ``on or about December 1910,'' Everdell nimbly places such supposedly pre-Modern thinkers and artists as Mach (whose name is still used to denote the speed of sound), Seurat, and Whitman in the long evolutionary trend of Modernism, demonstrating their influence on developments like relativity theory (Einstein), the invention of film (Thomas Edison), and High Modernism (Pound, Eliot, Williams). This inclusive view expands the commonly accepted Modernist canon; it also stresses the crucial nature of influence, showing, for instance, Picasso's cubism and Kandinsky's abstract expressionism prefiguring their interwar works, and the atonal music of Arthur Schoenberg exerting influence on Philip Glass. Everdell presents an intriguing chapter on Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau, governor of Cuba, and his grisly contribution to Modern culture in 1896: the concentration camp. Hitler and Stalin get only passing references, but it is the exclusion here of Michel Foucault in the discussion of penal institutions that seems glaring. Similarly, the absence of Ferdinand de Saussure in a chapter on phenomenology, which includes Bertrand Russell and Edmund Husserl, omits a giant in the field of sign study. Still, these are minor lapses in what is otherwise a sturdy and erudite overview of one of the most complex periods of thought. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>By 1912, nothing but fragments remained of the once-smooth masonry of culture, destroyed by radicals who dared to ask explosive new questions and to adopt destabilizing new perspectives. In a work of remarkable breadth, Everdell recounts the feats of these provocateurs--including Rimbaud and Freud, Joyce and Stein, Planck and Einstein, Schoenberg and Kandinsky--who destroyed the old cultural edifice and erected the structure called modernism in its place. While making full allowance for differences in aims and methods, Everdell nonetheless shows that all of the founders of modernism were groping toward a new conception of the universe as an aggregate of disparate and isolated elements. Whether in Kandinsky's untamed artistry, Joyce's experimental fiction, or Planck's quantum physics, the open vistas of tradition vanished, replaced by acute but disconnected glimpses of a startling world. By discerning the deep-down kinship of set theorists in mathematics, of symbolists in poetry, and of pointillists in painting, Everdell has performed a rare service for his readers. Dispelling much of the current nonsense about "postmodernism," this book belongs on the very short list of profound works of cultural analysis. <i>Bryce Christensen</i></p><h2>G. K.

However, this major new biography argues that Chesterton should be seen as the successor of the great Victorian prose writers, Carlyle, Arnold, Ruskin, and above all Newman. <br><br>Chesterton's achievement as one of the great English literary critics has not hitherto been fully recognized, perhaps because his best literary criticism is of prose rather than poetry. Ian Ker remedies this neglect, paying particular attention to Chesterton's writings on the Victorians, especially Dickens. As a social and political thinker, Chesterton is contrasted here with contemporary intellectuals like Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells in his championing of democracy and the masses. Pre-eminently a controversialist, as revealed in his prolific journalistic output, he became a formidable apologist for Christianity and Catholicism, as well as a powerful satirist of anti-Catholicism. <br><br>This full-length life of G. K. Chesterton is the first comprehensive biography of both the man and the writer. It draws on many unpublished letters and papers to evoke Chesterton's joyful humour, his humility and affinity to the common man, and his love of the ordinary things of life.<br></p><p><br>Ian Ker has taught both English literature and theology in universities in the United States and Britain, where he currently teaches in the Oxford theology faculty. He is the author and editor of more than twenty books on Newman, including <em>John Henry Newman: A Biography</em> (1988), as well as the author of <em>The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845-1961</em> (2003).<br><br>"Magisterial new biography."--<em>Catholic Herald</em><p></p><br>"This masterly biography has the potential to help establish Chesterton in what Ker regards as his rightful place as a major English author." --<em>The Independent on Sunday</em><p></p><br>"[A] tremendous biography."--<em>The Tablet</em><p></p><br>"A discriminating portrait that does welcome justice to the full richness of [Chesterton s] hitherto undervalued work the need for a proper critical biography has long been acknowledged and Ker has supplied it for any true understanding of the scope of Chesterton s achievement Ker s biography will be indispensable." --<em>The Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"This is a brilliant biography for a brilliant man."--<em>Times Higher Education Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Chesterton finally gets the big book he deserves a monumental study." --<em>The National Catholic Register</em><p></p><br>"Heroically researched. . . an impressive [book]. . . that conveys a powerful sense of [Chesterton's] personality."--DJ Taylor, <em>The Independent</em><p></p><br>"Magisterial.... a splendid book."--<em>Touchstone</em><p></p><br>"This is a full-length scholarly biography that will be indispensable for decades"--<em>Church Times</em><p></p><br>"Professor Ker's spirited and double-barreled attempt at a rehabilitation of his cherished subject is enjoyable in its own right, and takes in such matters as Chesterton's dialectical genius for paradox, the authority of the Father Brown stories in the detective genre, and the salience of Charles Dickens in the English canonical one."--Christopher Hitchens, <em>The Atlantic</em><p></p><br>"magnificent"--Peter Costello, <em>The Irish Catholic</em><p></p><br>". . . detailed and compelling. . ."--Jay Parini, <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> <br><p></p><br>"[A] comprehensive biolography." --<em>The Lutheran</em><p></p><br>"Spirited and ...

This powerful and provocative book draws from a wide range of disciplines&#x2014;from anthropology to psychoanalysis, from film and fiction to literary theory&#x2014;to explore these profound changes in our understanding of self-identity and their implications for cultural and intellectual life.</p><p><b>Kenneth J. Gergen,</b> Ph.D., is professor of psychology at Swarthmore College. He is the author of, among other works, <i>Toward Transformation in Social Knowledge</i> (1982) and, with co-editor John Shotter, <i>Texts of Identity</i> (1989)."Social saturation" is Gergen's term for ordinary people living with constant change, bombarded by electronic messages, open to a vast range of personal relationships. Under this sensory assault, the self as a known entity breaks down and the post-modern woman or man, cast adrift in a world of limitless possibilities, advances from the "pastiche personality" to the energy vortex of the "relational self" ("the relationship replaces the individual as the center of human action"). This dizzying scenario is anchored by a discussion of "self-reflective" movies and TV shows (Woody Allen, David Letterman ) , coalescing artistic genres, anthropological comparisons, deconstructivism, with examples drawn from popular culture. Swarthmore psychology professor Gergen touches raw nerves, scrutinizing unmoored selves naked to experience in this highly stimulating, mind-expanding original work which dusts away the cliches surrounding that tiresome phrase, "the post-modern condition." <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation</h2><p>From John Hope Franklin, America's foremost African American historian, comes this groundbreaking analysis of slave resistance and escape. A sweeping panorama of plantation life before the Civil War, this book reveals that slaves <em>frequently</em> rebelled against their masters and ran away from their plantations whenever they could.<br> For generations, important aspects about slave life on the plantations of the American South have remained shrouded. Historians thought, for instance, that slaves were generally pliant and resigned to their roles as human chattel, and that racial violence on the plantation was an aberration. In this precedent setting book, John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, significant numbers of slaves did in fact frequently rebel against their masters and struggled to attain their freedom. By surveying a wealth of documents, such as planters' records, petitions to county courts and state legislatures, and local newspapers, this book shows how slaves resisted, when, where, and how they escaped, where they fled to, how long they remained in hiding, and how they survived away from the plantation. Of equal importance, it examines the reactions of the white slaveholding class, revealing how they marshaled considerable effort to prevent runaways, meted out severe punishments, and established patrols to hunt down escaped slaves. <br> Reflecting a lifetime of thought by our leading authority in African American history, this book provides the key to truly understanding the relationship between slaveholders and the runaways who challenged the system--illuminating as never before the true nature of the South's "most peculiar institution."<br></p><p><i>Runaway Slaves</i> is yet another masterpiece from the esteemed African American historian John Hope Franklin, author of the influential <i>From Slavery to Freedom</i>. Along with history professor Loren Schweninger, Franklin examines the often unexplored phenomenon of slave resistance--specifically, that of runaway slaves. For too long, there has been a myth that slaves were happy with their condition. Armed with the data from numerous Wanted posters, letters, county-court petitions, and newspapers, Franklin and Schweninger prove that slaves were in a constant state of rebellion with their masters. The intense circle of violence between blacks and whites was marked by property sabotage, work stoppage, assault, murder, and escape into the North. "Perhaps the greatest impact runaways had on the peculiar institution," the authors suggest, "was in their defiance of the system. Masters and slaves knew that there were blacks who were willing to do almost anything to extricate themselves from bondage." Comprehensive in scholarship and compelling in prose, this book sheds light on an underappreciated aspect of the American quest for freedom. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>In this book, John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, significant numbers of slaves did in fact frequently rebel against their masters and struggle to attain their freedom. By surveying a wealth of documents, such as planters&#39; records, petitions to county courts and state legislatures, and local newspapers, this book shows how slaves resisted; when, where, and how they escaped; where they fled to; how long they remained in hiding; and how they survived away from the plantation.

Reflecting a lifetime of thought by our leading authority in African American history, this book provides the key to truly understanding the relationship between slaveholders and the runaways who challenged the system - illuminating as never before the true nature of the South&#39;s &#34;most peculiar institution.&#34;</p><h2>Corporate Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation</h2><p>This innovative book will be a useful and trusted reference throughout your career, no matter which company or industry you work within.

In this pioneering study, leading scholar Martha Drexler Lynn explores how and why this shift occurred by examining the pivotal period for the maturation of American studio ceramics. Lynn traces critical developments in ceramics education, exhibition, patronage, and technology from 1940 to 1979, as magazines dedicated to the practice appeared, institutional support flourished, audiences grew, and star artists emerged.<br> &nbsp;<br> The most in-depth history of American studio ceramics to date, this book is the first to fully explore the works of art alongside the societal trends that shaped them and the organizations that propelled the movement. Lynn considers the movement&#x2019;s fluctuation across geographic regions as well as stylistic responses to advances in technology and cultural influences from across the United States and abroad. &nbsp;Key patrons and practitioners such as Aileen Osborn Webb, Glen Lukens, Peter Voulkos, and Robert Arneson are featured alongside lesser-known figures.&nbsp; This groundbreaking volume illustrates how studio ceramics came to define itself and challenged the boundaries between fine art and craft.&nbsp; It will be a definitive resource on the movement for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>This landmark book explores the formative years of the American studio ceramics movement and offers the most in-depth history to date of the people, institutions, and events that shaped it.<br><b>Martha Drexler Lynn </b>is an independent scholar and former associate curator of decorative arts at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.<br></p><h2>Technical Communication: Process and Product (8th Edition)</h2><p><i> <b> <i>Technical Communication: Process and Product, 8e</i> </b> </i>by Sharon J.

Nabokov's protagonist, Smurov, is a lovelorn, excruciatingly self-conscious Russian �migr� living in prewar Berlin, who commits suicide after being humiliated by a jealous husband, only to suffer even greater indignities in the afterlife.</p><p>Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov was born on April 23, 1899, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of antisemitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins. <br><br>The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov, alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next eighteen years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym Sirin and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925 he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri. <br><br>Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. In his afterword to <b>Lolita</b> he claimed: "My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any of those apparatuses--the baffling mirror, the black velvet backdrop, the implied associations and traditions--which the native illusionist, frac-tails flying, can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way." [p. 317] Yet Nabokov's American period saw the creation of what are arguably his greatest works, <b>Bend Sinister</b> (1947), <b>Lolita</b> (1955), <b>Pnin</b> (1957), and <b>Pale Fire</b> (1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Jane Eyre (Puffin Classics)</h2><p><b>Jane Eyre is one of the most loved English Classics of all time!</b> <br><br>Mystery, hardship--and love.

Altschuler shows, in particular, how rock's "switchblade beat" opened up wide fissures in American society along the fault-lines of family, sexuality, and race. For instance, the birth of rock coincided with the Civil Rights movement and brought "race music" into many white homes for the first time. Elvis freely credited blacks with originating the music he sang and some of the great early rockers were African American, most notably, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. In addition, rock celebrated romance and sex, rattled the reticent by pushing sexuality into the public arena, and mocked deferred gratification and the obsession with work of men in gray flannel suits. And it delighted in the separate world of the teenager and deepened the divide between the generations, helping teenagers differentiate themselves from others. Altschuler includes vivid biographical sketches of the great rock 'n rollers, including Elvis Presley, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly--plus their white-bread doppelgangers such as Pat Boone.<br> Rock 'n roll seemed to be everywhere during the decade, exhilarating, influential, and an outrage to those Americans intent on wishing away all forms of dissent and conflict. As vibrant as the music itself, <em>All Shook Up</em> reveals how rock 'n roll challenged and changed American culture and laid the foundation for the social upheaval of the sixties.</p><p><br><strong>Glenn Altschuler</strong> is Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies and Dean of the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions at Cornell University. He is the author of several books on American history and popular culture, including <em>Changing Channels: America in TV Guide</em>.<br><br>"One of the first to do rock-and-roll the significant service of locating it within the cultural and political maelstrom it helped to create. Altschuler does so with a good ear for the music and a deft hand, making this account a pleasure to read and ponder. He is not a flashy writer, but so much the better for his storytelling, which shows intelligence and narrative discipline.... Altschuler surpasses the admittedly sparsely populated field in the nuanced way he places the music within the conflicts--racial, sexual, commercial, and political--that it variously helped to encourage, exacerbate, and (occasionally) ameliorate. Altschuler tells a story of liberation and fear, of inspiration and exploitation, of repeated attempts to homogenize a form of cultural expression that sprang from somewhere so authentic in Western youth culture that it proved bigger and more powerful than any combination of its myriad opponents."--Eric Alterman, <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em><p></p><br>"A fascinating and important look at a pivotal decade in American history.... Put on those old 45s and curl up for an enlightening and eminently readable story."--<em>PW Daily</em><p></p><br>"In <em>All Shook Up</em>, Glenn C. Altschuler vividly demonstrates that Rock 'n' Roll--as music, lyric, and gesture--provides the guide, the Ariadne's thread, through the labyrinth of social, cultural, generational, and sexual upheaval that was post-World War II America."--Kevin Starr, author of <em>Americans</em> <em>and the California Dream</em><p></p><br>"A soulful, scholarly, and thoroughly fascinating examination of the transforming power of rock and roll in American culture. Brandishing the chops of a loving fan and a scrupulous historian, Altschuler nimbly tracks the rock-propelled revolutions in manners and morality that first rumbled forth from the 1950s, a decade that seems ever more the epoch of Elvis not Eisenhower. His is a finely tuned, perfectly pitched appreciation of the rhythms of a music that became not only a soundtrack but a heartbeat to American life."--Thomas Doherty, Brandeis University<p></p><br>"A remarkably thorough short history of the birth of rock and roll and its cultural contexts. Glenn Altschuler manages to weave the stories of musicians and record producers, cultural critics and legislators, psychologists and sociologists, businessmen and teenaged consumers into a lively, astute narrative of cultural change. The result is not just an especially informative history of rock, but an important cultural history of the 'long' 1950s."--Tom Lutz, author of <em>Crying: A Natural and Cultural History of Tears</em> and <em>American Nervousness, 1903: An Anecdotal History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Spotify For Dummies</h2><p><b>The ultimate beginner guide to the groundbreaking music service, Spotify!</b> <p>Spotify is a free online streaming music platform that allows users to listen to songs on demand over the Internet--without having to buy or own the actual tracks.

Lavishly illustrated, with many accompanying maps and charts, each volume presents a synthesis of current scholarly research and interpretation, carefully checked, translated, and revised for an English-speaking readership. Volume 2 begins at the turn of the millennium and covers the extraordinary rebirth of Europe, in terms of demographic expansion, agrarian settlement and organization, the establishment of towns and villages, the ascendancy of the feudal system, the appearance of formal states and kingdoms, and the dramatic controlling ascendancy of the Western Church. In the East, despite the external appearance of grandeur, the Islamic countries were being torn apart by mutual rivalry, while the Byzantine empire lost massive border territories through political and economic incompetence. As in Volumes 1 (350-950) and 3 (1250-1520), full coverage is given to both East and West, and their artistic heritage is vividly displayed in many of the color plates. A comprehensive bibliography is also included as an aid to further investigation, whether by general readers or by students of the period.</p><p>This is the long-awaited second volume of one of the finest general introductions to the medieval world of recent times.

On the other hand, having been a basic research scientist throughout my career, I remain convinced that a fundamental understanding of basic physical sciences is necessary for a deeper appreciation of biology and ecology. And so, over time, my teaching philosophy has evolved to one where I almost trick students into learning basic science. What I mean is, they already appreciate the oceans--the parts of the oceans they have had exposure to, that is--and so we already have their interest. All we need to do is build on that intuitive and still na�ve interest and show students why our oceans are, in fact, even <em>more</em> interesting--and important.<br><br><em>Oceanography and Marine Biology</em> preserves the basic elements of the physical, chemical, and geological aspects of the marine sciences, and merges those fundamentals into a broader framework of marine biology and ecology. I have found that this approach works: my class of 350 students fills every semester it is offered, with students on waiting lists to get in. But existing textbooks on oceanography or marine biology address the companion field only cursorily: very few pages in oceanography texts are devoted to marine biology, and vice versa. This new book overcomes that imbalance, bringing these disparate marine science text formats closer together, giving them more equal weight, and introducing more effectively the physical sciences by showing students with everyday examples how such concepts form the foundation upon which to build a better understanding of the marine environment in a changing world.<br><br>I invite you to take a look at the book, and welcome your comments on it.<br><br>David W.

In 1855, an answer came with Walt Whitman&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Leaves of Grass</i>.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Today, this masterful collection remains not only a seminal event in American literature but also the incomparable achievement of one of America&#x2019;s greatest poets&#x2014;an exuberant, passionate man who loved his country and wrote of it as no other has ever done. Walt Whitman&nbsp;was a singer, thinker, visionary, and citizen extraordinaire. Thoreau called Whitman &#x201c;probably the greatest democrat that ever lived,&#x201d; and Emerson judged <i>Leaves of Grass</i> as &#x201c;the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The text presented here is that of the &#x201c;Deathbed&#x201d; or ninth edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, published in 1892. The content and grouping of poems is the version authorized by Whitman himself for the final and complete edition of his masterpiece.</b></p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>The Hellenistic Age from the Battle of Ipsos to the Death of Kleopatra VII (Translated Documents of Greece and Rome, Series Number 3)</h2><p>Greek and Roman history has largely been reconstructed from the works of Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, and other major authors who are today well represented in English translations. But much equally valuable documentary material is buried in inscriptions and papyri and in the works of Greek and Roman grammarians and scholars, and less well known historians and literary figures, of whose writings only isolated quotations have been preserved. Translated Documents of Greece and Rome has been planned to provide, above all, primary source material for the study of the classical world. It makes important historical documents available in English to scholars and students of classical history. The format of the translations is remarkable in attempting to reproduce faithfully the textual difficulties and uncertainties inherent in the documents, so that the reader without a knowledge of classical languages can assess the reliability of the various readings and interpretations. The author&#39;s purpose in compiling this book is to help the teaching of Hellenistic history at undergraduate and graduate level by providing students and teachers with a representative selection of accurately translated documents dealing with the political and social history of Greece and the Near and Middle East from c. 300 to c. 30 BC. The continuing vitality of the Greek cities in the Hellenistic period and the interaction of Greek and non-Greek cultures in the Near and Middle East after Alexander are the two themes to which the author pays particular attention. In accordance with the principles of this series, selections from readily available major authors such as Polybius and Plutarch have been excluded except where unavoidable. Instead the bulk of the selections have been drawn from papyrological and epigraphical sources, many of which have never been translated into English before. The texts include city decrees and regulations, royal letters and ordinances, records of embassies and judicial decisions, dedications, treaties, statue bases, and documents dealing with the establishment of festivals, dynastic and other religious cults, education and other endowments. Brief commentaries and bibliographical notes accompany each text. Students and teachers of ancient history and classical civilization will welcome this book. Those studying Jewish history and the historical background of early Christianity will also find it interesting.</p><p>STANLEY M.

Covering agriculture, resources, energy, communication, transportation, manufacturing, and waste, this is the "Book of Everything" for the industrial landscape.<br><br>The objects that fill our everyday environment are streetlights, railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway overpasses, power lines, satellite dishes, and thousands of other manufactured items, many of them so familiar we hardly notice them. Larger and more exotic facilities have transformed vast tracts of the landscape: coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil refineries, and steel mills, to name a few. <i>Infrastructure</i> is a compelling and clear guide for those who want to explore and understand this mysterious world we've made for ourselves. 500 color illustrations.</p><p>We are surrounded by the hardware of the modern world, but how much of it do we even notice, much less understand? This unique and fascinating book covers the parts of the landscape that are often overlooked despite their ubiquity--objects such as utility poles, power lines, cell phone towers, highway overpasses, railroad tracks, factories, and other man-made mechanical marvels. And they are not just in urban areas, but include out of the way "ecosystems" such as mines, dams, wind farms, power plants, grain operators, steel mills, and oil refineries. In <i>Infrastructure</i>, Brian Hayes offers clear explanations of the systems that keep the modern world running, including agriculture, energy supplies, shipping, air transportation, and the various ingenious methods of recycling and managing the waste we generate. <p> Subtitled "A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape," the book is laid out like a nature guide, with comprehensive details and photographs on every page. "There can be just as much of interest happening on a factory rooftop as there is in the forest canopy, just as much to marvel at in the operation of a strip-mining dragline as in the geological carving of a river canyon," writes Hayes. A mine may not be as scenic as a mountain peak, but he argues it can hold as much fascination. His "chief aim is simply to describe and explain the technological fabric of society, not to judge whether it is good or bad, beautiful or ugly." In this he does an impressive job. He tells us how things work and why they are located where they are, and answers dozens of practical questions in the process. He also walks us through how raw materials such as coal, timber, petroleum, and water are converted and transported for use in our homes and businesses. Readers won't view the industrial landscape that same way after poring over this remarkable book. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><i>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape</i> now has its own web site, including a gallery of photographs and a forum where readers can post comments and ask questions.</p><h2>Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance, 1950-1963 (Americans and the California Dream)</h2><p>A narrative tour de force that combines wide-ranging scholarship with captivating prose, Kevin Starr's acclaimed multi-volume <em>Americans and the California Dream</em> is an unparalleled work of cultural history. In this volume, Starr covers the crucial postwar period--1950 to 1963--when the California we know today first burst into prominence.<br><br>Starr brilliantly illuminates the dominant economic, social, and cultural forces in California in these pivotal years. In a powerful blend of telling events, colorful personalities, and insightful analyses, Starr examines such issues as the overnight creation of the postwar California suburb, the rise of Los Angeles as Super City, the reluctant emergence of San Diego as one of the largest cities in the nation, and the decline of political centrism. He explores the Silent Generation and the emergent Boomer youth cult, the Beats and the Hollywood "Rat Pack," the pervasive influence of Zen Buddhism and other Asian traditions in art and design, the rise of the University of California and the emergence of California itself as a utopia of higher education, the cooling of West Coast jazz, freeway and water projects of heroic magnitude, outdoor life and the beginnings of the environmental movement. More broadly, he shows how California not only became the most populous state in the Union, but in fact evolved into a mega-state en route to becoming the global commonwealth it is today.<br><br><em>Golden Dreams</em> continues an epic series that has been widely recognized for its signal contribution to the history of American culture in California. It is a book that transcends its stated subject to offer a wealth of insight into the growth of the Sun Belt and the West and indeed the dramatic transformation of America itself in these pivotal years following the Second World War.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kevin Starr</strong> is University Professor and Professor of History, University of Southern California, and State Librarian of California Emeritus. His <em>Americans and the California Dream</em> series has earned him the National Medal for the Humanities, the Centennial Medal of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University, the Gold Medal of the Commonwealth Club of California, a Guggenheim fellowship, and election to the Society of American Historians.<br><br>"With the publication of <em>Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance, 1950-1963</em>, Kevin Starr has completed his transformation from the state's greatest historian to its indispensable one.... His eight-volume series, published under the umbrella title <em>Americans and the California Dream</em>, constitutes as comprehensive a social, political, ethnographic, cultural and philosophical history as any state is ever likely to achieve. It was conceived in dazzling ambition and masterfully executed. The author's scholarship and erudition animate each volume without once falling into the trap of self-regard. It is, in sum, an achievement made even more remarkable by the fact that it is wonderfully readable."--Tim Rutten, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"This final volume is of the same high quality as the previous ones: spirited in style... [a] wonderfully readable descriptive history...."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Monumental."--Benjamin Schwarz, <em>The Atlantic</em><p></p><br>"Starr's masterly accounts of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"Who besides Kevin Starr could cover the entire social, economic, political and artistic history of California during the era and somehow extrapolate it into an engaging, dazzling account of the emerging American Century."--Phyllis Filiberti Butler, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"Starr's magnum opus-eight volumes to date, and still not complete- will endure the test of years, not least for its heft and its dogged ambition. Students of California history-of the history of the American West generally-have no choice but to confront this impressive oeuvre penned over decades by the State Librarian of California Emeritus, now a professor at the University of Southern California."--<em>Books &amp; Culture</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Starr's <em>Golden Dreams</em>...is marvellously cohesive and concise, and Starr's engaging style makes it a pleasure to read." --<em>Times Literary Supplement Online</em><p></p><br>"Without parallel.

Medea (Loeb Classical Library No. 12)</h2><p><p>Euripides of Athens (ca. 485&#x2013;406 BCE), famous in every age for the pathos, terror, surprising plot twists, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations, wrote nearly ninety plays. Of these, eighteen (plus a play of unknown authorship mistakenly included with his works) have come down to us from antiquity. In this first volume of a new Loeb edition of Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text of three plays and an accurate and graceful translation with explanatory notes.</p><p><i>Alcestis</i> is the story of a woman who agrees, in order to save her husband's life, to die in his place. <i>Medea</i> is a tragedy of revenge in which Medea kills her own children, as well as their father's new wife, to punish him for his desertion. The volume begins with <i>Cyclops</i>, a satyr play&#x2014;the only complete example of this genre to survive. Each play is preceded by an introduction.</p><p>In a general introduction Kovacs demonstrates that the biographical tradition about Euripides&#x2014;parts of which view him as a subverter of morality, religion, and art&#x2014;cannot be relied on. He argues that this tradition has often furnished the unacknowledged starting point for interpretation, and that the way is now clear for an unprejudiced consideration of the plays themselves.</p></p><p><p>David Kovacs is Hugh H.

Old water spits and sizzles from the radiator joints, their copper fittings thick as vertebrae and leaking dirty steam. A blind is drawn across the room&#39;s one window closing out the Boston night, adorned with faded robins, bleached vines and the memory of flowers. Here is the ragged wheeze of sulphur-bitten lungs. Here are the woman&#39;s muffled squeals, made down her nose. The sallow, vaguely foreign-looking manager is standing by the wardrobe, queerly still, gas-mantle stuttering on the wall behind him splashing careless light upon his back, a yellow urinary glaze upon his oiled black hair, its slick topography. His Easter Island face is lost in shadow, save there, where the gaslight catches on his glistening cheek and errant muscle twitches. By the door, the Cuban maid turns off her hearing aid and swallows hard against the parching heat. She grips the tunic of the bell-boy beside her, digging four grey nails into his sleeve while he sips hesitantly from a pale blue cocktail cigarette that&#39;s balanced in the other hand. His uniform, a threadbare Burgundy, is tainted with a sickly orange by this wan, uneven light and half unbuttoned down the front, blotched dark with gin. Stood in the juddering mantle-glow, their shadows cringe amongst the huge primeval flowers disfiguring the sweltered wallpaper. They stare towards the bed. The Devil, red as tamarind, kneels in a rose of sweat-fogged sheets between the woman&#39;s arsenic-whitened thighs. His hairless body glistening as though freshly painted, one raw hand about each of her ankles where damp mocha hose is bunched. Her hands are bound with salmon shreds of nightgown to the condensation-beaded metal of the bed-head, fingers opening and closing like the thin limbs of albino crabs kept too long from the light. Balled up into a fist of silk her underwear is crammed into her mouth so that her cheeks bulge like an infant&#39;s. One suspender, spittle-silvered, has escaped the parted lips to trail across her chin. He pulls her onto Him, onto His frilled crustacean shaft and her vagina steams. Convulsed by great magnetic shudders He is roaring, snorting like a murdered horse as He ejaculates, an orgasm of jewels that floods her womb with Turquoise, Jade and Chrysolite. Salt streams of Beryl and Jacinth run down between her legs, the blue-ticked mattress turned to a cathedral-glass of brilliant stains. ...</p><h2>Western Civilizations: Their History and Their Culture (Brief Third Edition) (Vol. 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The best western civilizations text for emphasizing critical thinking, now in a brief edition.</strong></p> Master teachers and scholars, new co-authors Joshua Cole and Carol Symes integrate new and innovative pedagogical tools based on their own teaching experiences into this best-selling brief text to help students think critically, retain key information, and make connections.</p><p><p><strong>Joshua Cole</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Michigan.

It has been a century of war and colonialism, earnest reforms and blatant corruption, diplomatic maneuvering and political intrigue, an era colored by dramatic events and striking personalities. In <em>Bound to Empire</em>, acclaimed historian H.W. Brands gives us a brilliant account of the American involvement in the Philippines in a sweeping narrative filled with analytical insight.<br> Ranging from the Spanish-American War to the fall of Ferdinand Marcos and beyond, Brands deftly weaves together the histories of both nations as he assesses America's great experiment with empire. He leaps from the turbulent American scene in the 1890s--the labor unrest, the panic of 1893, the emergence of Progressivism, the growing tension with Spain--to the shores of the newly acquired colony: Dewey's conquest of Manila, the vicious war against the Philippine insurgents, and the founding of American civilian rule. As Brands takes us through the following century, describing the efforts to "civilize" the Filipinos, the shaping of Philippine political practices, the impact of General MacArthur, and World War II and the Cold War, he provides fascinating insight into the forces and institutions that made American rule what it was, and the Republic of the Philippines what it is today. He uncovers the origins of the corruption and nepotism of post-independence Philippine politics, as well as the ambivalence of American rule, in which liberal principles of self-determination clashed with the desire for empire and a preoccupation first with Japan and later with communism. The book comes right up to the present day, with an incisive account of the rise and fall of Ferdinand Marcos, the accession (and subsequent troubles) of Corazon Aquino, the Communist guerrilla insurgency, and the debate over the American military bases.<br> "Damn the Americans!" Manuel Quezon once said. "Why don't they tyrannize us more?" Indeed, as Brands writes, American rule in the Philippines was more benign than that of any other colonial power in the Pacific region. Yet it failed to foster a genuine democracy. This fascinating book explains why, in a perceptive account of a century of empire and its aftermath.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>H.W. Brands</strong> is Professor of History at Texas A &amp; M University. He is the author of <em>Inside the Cold War</em> as well as <em>Cold Warriors</em>, <em>The Specter of Neutralism</em>, and other books.<br>From the U.S. annexation of the Philippines in 1899 to independence in 1946, through a century of American domination, the relationship between the two has been a study of power--military, economic, and political. This thoughtful, well-conceived, and superbly written volume is perhaps the best in the string of books on the U.S. role in the Philippines. Clearly it is the most scholarly. Previously, Stanley Karnow's In Our Image ( LJ 4/1/89), Fred Poole and Max Vanzi's Revolution in the Philippines ( LJ 7/84. o.p.), and Stephen Rosskamm Shalom's The United States and the Philippines ( LJ 9/15/81. o.p.) have all examined the relationship. The importance of the islands was nowhere more evident than during World War II. The Philippines were also crucial to American anti-Communist strategy from the Cold War to Vietnam. Brands (history, Texas A&amp;M) provides a careful analysis of the people and events that shaped U.S. colonial policy. A well-researched and -documented monograph, this is bound to find a place in all libraries. Strongly recommended.<br><i>-Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ.

Genetic engineering has pushed evolution far beyond nature&#39;s boundaries, defeating disease and producing extraordinary spaceborn creatures. Huge fleets of sentient trader starships thrive on the wealth created by the industrialization of entire star systems. And throughout inhabited space the Confederation Navy keeps the peace. A true golden age is within our grasp. But now something has gone catastrophically wrong. On a primitive colony planet a renegade criminal&#39;s chance encounter with an utterly alien entity unleashes the most primal of all our fears. An extinct race, which inhabited the galaxy aeons ago called it &#34;The Reality Dysfunction&#34;. It is the nightmare, which has prowled beside us since the beginning of history. &#34;Absolute vintage science-fiction. Hamilton puts British sci-fi back into interstellar overdrive&#34; - &#34;The Times&#34;.</p><p>For humans, life in the twenty-seventh century has become secure and easy. The lightbarrier has been broken. Hundreds of worlds have been colonized. Genetic engineering has increased life-expectancy and banished disease. The Confederation Navy maintains the peace between humanity&#x2019;s rich and diverse cultures. It is the greatest era in history.All this is observed by a Ly-cilph, one of an ancient incorporial alien species who travel the galaxy gathering information. On Lalonde, a newly settled world, its interest in a criminal&#x2019;s profane ritual murder becomes a little too involved. What was once regarded as myth is unwittingly set free, allowing the heart of every human nightmare to flourish and expand. Technology is powerless against it. There is no place it cannot reach. It is as merciless as it is relentless.As the rest of the Confederation becomes aware of the horrific force which is destined to consume entire worlds, a name emerges from the chaos and terror engulfing Lalonde: The Reality Dysfunction.Peter F. Hamilton was born in Rutland in 1960, and still lives near Rutland Water.

Theirs are stories of oppression and survival, of family and community self-help, of inspiring heroism and grass-roots organizational continuity in the face of racism, economic hardship, and, far too often, violence. Their vivid accounts, their strong and insistent voices, make for inspiring reading, enriching our understanding of the American past.</p><p>&#34;Gerda Lerner has collected...material which can change images that whites have had of Blacks, and possibly even those which we, as Blacks, have of ourselves.&#34;--Maya Angelou<b>Gerda Lerner&nbsp;</b>(1920&#x2013;2013)&nbsp;was a prominent historian, activist, educator, writer, and one of the founders of the study of women's history.

Two well-respected writers and researchers, Bob Frank and Ben Bernanke, have shown that the less-is-more approach affords similar gains in introductory economics. The authors introduce a <em>coherent short list of core principles</em> and reinforce them by illustrating and applying each in numerous contexts. With engaging questions, explanations and exercises, the authors help students relate economic principles to a host of everyday experiences such as going to the ATM or purchasing airline tickets. Throughout this process, the authors encourage students to become <em>economic naturalists:</em> people who employ basic economic principles to understand and explain what they observe in the world around them.</p></p><p>Robert H.

Linda Davis, who edited <i>The Passionate Observer</i>, selected passages that reflect Fabre's careful, painstaking study of the natural world, which he undertook "to increase by one atom the general mass of knowledge, the incomparable treasure of mankind."

She lives in Berlin.Novel by Heinrich Boll, first published in German as <i>Billard um halbzehn</i> in 1959. In its searing examination of the moral crises of postwar Germany, the novel resembles Boll's other fiction; its interior monologues and flashbacks, however, make it his most complex work. The novel examines the lives of three generations of architects and their responses to the Nazi regime and its aftermath. The present-day action takes place on the 80th birthday of patriarch Heinrich Fahmel, who built St. Anthony's Abbey. At the end of World War II, his son Robert destroyed the abbey to protest the church's complicity with the Nazis; Robert's son, Joseph, is serving his apprenticeship by helping to restore St. Anthony's. All three characters confront their relationship to building and destruction, as well as their personal and historical past. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encylopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Three Lives and Q.E.D.: A Norton Critical Edition (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>This Norton Critical Edition includes both <em>Three Lives</em> and <em>Q.E.D.</em>, first published in 1909 and 1950, respectively.</strong></p><em>Three Lives</em> is comprised of the stories "The Good Anna," "Melanchtha," and "The Gentle Lena."&nbsp; "Melanchtha" is an adaptation of <em>Q.E.D.</em>, Stein&#x2019;s first completed novel, which remained unpublished until four years after her death.<br><br> "Contexts" is divided into two sections&#x2015;"Biography" and "Intellectual Backgrounds"&#x2015;that highlight the inspirations for and evolutions of <em>Three Lives</em> and discuss the difficult reception Stein&#x2019;s experimental writing met with in the publishing world.<br><br> "Criticism" collects 19 chronologically arranged essays on Stein&#x2019;s life and work, from pieces written during the decades in which her work was regarded as important primarily for its influence on writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Sherwood Anderson to the more laudatory scholarship of recent years.&nbsp; Feminism and form, queer studies, interrelations of race and sexuality, African American studies, and primitivism and eugenics are all represented.&nbsp; Among the critical pieces are William Carlos Williams&#x2019;s commentary on Stein&#x2019;s complexity and originality, Richard Bridgman&#x2019;s study of Stein&#x2019;s work as a possible compensation and camouflage for her lesbianism, and Lisa Ruddick&#x2019;s essay connecting feminist analysis to theories of consciousness.<br><br> A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.</p><p>Consists of three character studies of women; &#34;The Good Anna&#34;--a kind but domineering German servingwoman; &#34;Melanctha&#34;--an uneducated but sensitive black girl; &#34;The Gentle Lena&#34;--a pathetically feebleminded young German maid.In these three stories, Gertrude Stein put into practice certain theories about prose composition that paralleled the ideas expressed in the art of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters.</p><h2>The Indiscreet Jewels</h2><p>A satire on the court of King Louis XV of France features a bored Sultan to whom a genie gives a magic ring that requires each woman&#39;s body to speak the truth about her affairs</p><p>Diderot's erotic, subversive first novel, published anonymously in 1748, was a hit at the time, and no wonder: it is an allegory that portrays the king of France, Louis XV, as the sultan Mangogul of the Congo for whose amusement a magic ring is procured that makes women's genitals ("jewels") talk. The sultan's high-principled favorite, Mirzoza (Mme. de Pompadour), disapproves of his prurient curiosity; she foresees, correctly, that the indiscretion of the seraglio's "jewels" will wreck marriages and upset institutions. Clearly, Diderot's tale is more than a romp, as Adam Vartanian's long-winded introduction to this edition belabors; it is a novel of ideas in which "jewels" function as the vehicle of philosophy to enlighten society. Diderot managed his delicate high-wire act between adulation and satire so well that he wasn't thrown in jail until years later. With this new translation--serviceable but at times snagged in anachronisms-- Les bijoux indiscrets begs fresh consideration for curriculums and libraries.<br><i>- Amy Boaz, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2><p><p> <i>A beautiful restoration of Steadman's 1968 edition.</i> </p><p> The force of social satire and fantasy in the original text of <b>Alice in Wonderland</b> is as relevant today as when the novel was first published in 1865. This version of Carroll's classic tale is a startling departure from the traditional Victorian or Disney approaches. In his introduction, Ralph Steadman describes how a fresh illustrative perspective created an original, modern vision. </p><p> The irony and satire of <b>Alice in Wonderland</b> acquires new life with Steadman's audacious and dynamic illustrations. The 47 pen and ink illustrations from the critically acclaimed 1968 British edition are faithfully restored and reformatted. The energy, imagination and power of Steadman's pen introduces the wit and wisdom of Alice to a new generation of readers. </p></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

The author&#x2019;s unique analysis of Jefferson&#x2019;s thoughts on these crucial issues and their impact on the formation of the United States make this edition of the Notes the first to present these issues as fundamentally inseparable. A collection of lively letters and other documents related to the Notes accompanies them, and charts the evolution of the book in the revolutionary crucible and during the heady early days of the new nation. An introduction by David Waldstreicher places the work in the contexts of the Revolution and the social and cultural history of Jefferson&#x2019;s Virginia, with particular attention to developing ideas about race and nature. A chronology of the life and career of Thomas Jefferson and selected bibliography also add to the pedagogical benefits of this volume.</p><p>"[Peden] has made available the authoritative edition of one of the most important books to emerge in eighteenth-century America. He has set forth the history of its reception and criticism in such a way as to establish his point that in the 'Notes on Virginia' Jefferson 'produced one of America's first permanent literary and intellectual landmarks.'"-- <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i> <br>This American classic is the only full-length book written and published by Thomas Jefferson during his lifetime. Written in 1781, Notes on the State of Virginia was begun by Jefferson as a commentary on the resources and institutions of his home state, but the work&#39;s lasting value lies in its delineation of Jefferson&#39;s major philosophical, political, scientific, and ethical beliefs. Along with his accounts of such factual matters as North American flora and fauna, Jefferson expounds his views on slavery, education, religious freedom, representative government, and the separation of church and state. The book is the best single statement of Jefferson&#39;s principles and the best reflection of his wide-ranging tastes and talents.

He concludes by discussing the direction in which democracy must move if advanced democratic states are to exist in the future.<p>"Like democratic theory itself, Dahl's book is hugely inspiring. . . . this is a hugely impressive book, which traces the assumptions of democratic theory from 5th-century Athens to the present day and beyond. it is remarkable for its sustained attempt to connect theory and practice."&#x2014;Susan Mendus, <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i></p><br>"One of the foremost contemporary theorists of pluralist democracy."&#x2015;Jack Lively, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br>"[This book] could not have come at a more opportune moment. . . . <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> is a work of extraordinary intelligence and, what is even rarer, a work of extraordinary wisdom.

The reader becomes a mute but engrossed participant in a brilliant but also meticulously detailed series of discussions in which few issues are skipped over or arguments left hanging, as almost every train of thought is carried to its logical termination. The atmosphere of a sustained seminar is reinforced by Dahl's ingenious use of the playwright's technique of heated dialogues and verbal crossing of swords."&#x2014;Lucian W. Pye, <i>American Political Science Review</i><br>"It's difficult to imagine a political science seminar in which this lucid and thoughtful book would not stimulate energetic discussion. . . . Even those who have followed Dahl's writings of the past forty years will find many riches. . . . This book encouraged me to think about some old problems in new ways. I encourage others to enjoy similar benefits."&#x2015;G. Bingham Powell, Jr., <i>Political Science Quarterly</i><br>"<i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> is a rigorous summary of the life work of one of America's premier political scientists. It is also a timely antidote to the right's equation of democracy with the 'freedom' of an unrestrained capitalist market. In a reasoned yet passionate tone Dahl defends democracy as a system of political equality that promotes the freedom of individuals to live under laws of their own choosing. . . . Radical theorists who have recently discovered the centrality of 'plurality' and 'civil society' owe a considerable debt to Dahl's work. . . . As Dahl's work eloquently demonstrates, the moral values of liberal democracy can only be realized if our economic institutions are shaped by the values of political equality."&#x2015;Joseph M. Schwartz, <i>Dissent</i><br>"A provocative, scholarly, and elegantly written book."&#x2015;Elizabeth P. McCaughey, <i>National Review</i><br>"This thoughtful defense of democratic values . . . provide[s] a theoretical justification for leaving public policy decisions squarely in the domain of democratically elected representatives. . . . Time spent with <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> will repay both the scholar and the general reader with insight into the issues of democratic theory that bear on the continual debate over the proper role of an independent judiciary in a democratic society. . . . He brilliantly defends democracy against its critics, including those who would have judges play the active role of guardians in our society. Lawyers and legal scholars will benefit from the theoretical context this book brings to the debate over judicial policymaking, and the reader will appreciate the clarity and thoroughness of Dahl's entire argument."&#x2015;Cary Coglianese, <i>Michigan Law Review</i><br>"In this capstone volume, Dahl interweaves normative and empirical notions in an effort to develop a broadly integrative theory of democracy, on that is at once historically grounded, context sensitive, true to its philosophical origins, and sustainable under scrutiny. His effort is . . . remarkable. . . . <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> is the product of literally decades of observation and analysis by one of the nation's premier political theorists, and in its breadth of vision and depth of insight it gives testimony to the quality of the author's mind. The book is well crafted, as Dahl's books always are, and is presented in a style that will prove accessible to the professional and the lay reader alike and to political scientists of both normative and empirical bent. . . . A benchmark in the development of democratic thought at a time when clear thinking about the ideal and practical forms of democracy is especially in demand."&#x2015;Jarol B. Manheim, <i>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</i><br>"[Dahl] does well in introducing us to the problems and dilemmas that surround the attempts to achieve democracy. . . . It is a very useful book, especially for a course in democratic theory."&#x2015;Allan R. MacLeod, <i>Canadian Journal of Political Science</i><br>"[A] crowning achievement . . . [and a] timely work."&#x2015;Philip Green, <i>Social Theory and Practice</i><br>Winner of the 1991 Elaine and David Spitz Book Award given by the International Conference for the Study of Political Thought for the best book published on liberal and/or democratic theory <br>Winner of the&nbsp;1990 Woodrow Wilson Foundation Book Award given by the American Political Science Association for the best book published in the United States during the previous year on government, politics, or international affairs <br><br>"Robert Dahl is both a subtle analyst and a staunch defender of democratic values. What impresses me most is that he sees democracy not just as something fixed or given, but as a process that needs to be extended into every area of society, the economic as well as the political. His new book continues his splendid work."&#x2014;Irving Howe<br>"This elegantly written book presents a synthesis of over thirty years of work by America's leading post-war democratic theorist. Dahl's clear, incisive style will appeal to the general reader as well as to specialists in political theory and comparative politics."&#x2015;Alan Ware, University of Warwick<br></p><h2>Exam Review for Milady Standard Comprehensive Training for Estheticians</h2><p>This Exam Review serves as a convenient preparatory tool for students studying to take the licensure exam for esthetics.

During the antebellum era, slave owners ate the greens from the pot and set aside the leftover potlikker broth for the enslaved, unaware that the broth, not the greens, was nutrient rich. After slavery, potlikker sustained the working poor, both black and white. In the South of today, potlikker has taken on new meanings as chefs have reclaimed it.&nbsp;Potlikker is a quintessential Southern dish, and&nbsp;<i>The Potlikker Papers</i>&nbsp;is a people&#x2019;s history of the modern South, told through its food. Beginning with the pivotal role cooks and waiters played in the civil rights movement, noted authority John T. Edge narrates the South&#x2019;s fitful journey from a hive of racism to a hotbed of American immigration. He shows why working-class Southern food has become a vital driver of contemporary American cuisine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Food access was a battleground issue during the 1950s and 1960s. Ownership of culinary traditions has remained a central contention on the long march toward equality.&nbsp;<i>The Potlikker Papers</i>&nbsp;tracks pivotal moments in Southern history, from the back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s to the rise of fast and convenience foods modeled on rural staples. Edge narrates the gentrification that gained traction in the restaurants of the 1980s and the artisanal renaissance that began to reconnect farmers and cooks in the 1990s. He reports as a newer South came into focus in the 2000s and 2010s, enriched by the arrival of immigrants from Mexico to Vietnam and many points in between. Along the way, Edge profiles extraordinary figures in Southern food, including Fannie Lou Hamer, Colonel Sanders, Mahalia Jackson, Edna Lewis, Paul Prudhomme, Craig Claiborne, and Sean Brock.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the last three generations, wrenching changes have transformed the South.&nbsp;<i>The Potlikker Papers</i>&nbsp;tells the story of that dynamism&#x2014;and reveals how Southern food has become a shared culinary language for the nation.</p><p>John T.

But for this ornament, and a copy of The Hound of the Baskervilles which lay beside it, the room showed no traces of human use, and Mrs. Spragg herself wore as complete an air of detachment as if she had been a wax figure in a show-window. Her attire was fashionable enough to justify such a post, and her pale soft-cheeked face, with puffy eye-lids and drooping mouth, suggested a partially melted wax figure which had run to double-chin.<br><br>Mrs. Heeny, in comparison, had a reassuring look of solidity and reality. The planting of her firm black bulk in its chair, and the grasp of her broad red hands on the gilt arms, bespoke an organized and self-reliant activity, accounted for by the fact that Mrs. Heeny was a "society" manicure and masseuse. Toward Mrs. Spragg and her daughter she filled the double role of manipulator and friend; and it was in the latter capacity that, her day's task ended, she had dropped in for a moment to "cheer up" the lonely ladies of the Stentorian.<br><br>The young girl whose "form" had won Mrs. Heeny's professional commendation suddenly shifted its lovely lines as she turned back from the window.<br><br>"Here-you can have it after all," she said, crumpling the note and tossing it with a contemptuous gesture into her mother's lap.<br><br>"Why-isn't it from Mr. Popple?" Mrs. Spragg exclaimed unguardedly.<br><br>"No-it isn't. What made you think I thought it was?" snapped her daughter; but the next instant she added, with an outbreak of childish disappointment: "It's only from Mr. Marvell's sister-at least she says she's his sister."<br><br>Mrs. Spragg, with a puzzled frown, groped for her eye-glass among the jet fringes of her tightly girded front.<br><br>Mrs. Heeny's small blue eyes shot out sparks of curiosity. "Marvell-what Marvell is that?"</p><h2>Saudek</h2><p>A selection of 80 erotic photographs by Czech photographer, Jan Saudek.</p><p>Text: English, French, German</p><h2>The Wildlife Techniques Manual: (Volume 1: Research/ Volume 2: Management)</h2><p><p>Winner of the Wildlife Society Outstanding Edited Book of the Wildlife Society</p><p>Since its original publication in 1960, <i>The Wildlife Techniques Manual</i> has remained the cornerstone text for the professional wildlife biologist.

Scott Fitzgerald: Novels and Stories 1920-1922: This Side of Paradise / Flappers and Philosophers / The Beautiful and the Damned / Tales of the Jazz Age (Library of America)</h2><p>At the outset of what he called "the greatest, the gaudiest spree in history," F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the works that brought him instant fame, mastering the glittering aphoristic prose and keen social observation that would distinguish all his writing. This Library of America volume brings together four volumes that collectively offer the fullest literary expression of one of the most fascinating eras in American life.<br><br><i>This Side of Paradise</i>&nbsp;(1920) gave Fitzgerald the early success that defined and haunted him for the rest of his career. Offering in its Princeton chapters the most enduring portrait of college life in American literature, this lyrical novel records the ardent and often confused longings of its hero's struggles to find love and to formulate a philosophy of life.<br><br><i>Flappers and Philosophers</i>&nbsp;(1920), a collection of accomplished short stories, includes such classics as "Dalyrimple Goes Wrong," "Bernice Bobs Her Hair," and "The Ice Palace."<br><br>Fitzgerald continues his dissection of a self-destructive era in his second novel,&nbsp;<i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>&nbsp;(1922), as the self-styled aristocrat Anthony Patch and his beautiful wife, Gloria, are cut off from an inheritance and forced to endure the excruciating dwindling of their fortune. Here New York City, playground for the pleasure-loving Patches and brutal mirror of their dissipation, is portrayed more vividly than anywhere else in Fitzgerald's work.<br><br><i>Tales of the Jazz Age</i>&nbsp;(1922), his second collection of stories, includes the novella "May Day," featuring interlocking tales of debutantes, soldiers, and socialists brought together in the uncertain aftermath of World War I, and "A Diamond as Big as the Ritz," a fable in which the excesses of the Jazz Age take the hallucinatory form of a palace of unfathomable opulence hidden deep in the Montana Rockies.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p><b>Jackson R. Bryer</b>, volume editor, is professor emeritus of English at the University of Maryland and the editor of&nbsp;<i>F. Scott Fitzgerald: The Critical Reception</i>&nbsp;and, with John Kuehl,&nbsp;<i>Dear Scott / Dear Max: The Fitzgerald&#x2013;Perkins Correspondence</i>.Young Scott Fitzgerald was not having much luck: he'd flunked out of Princeton, his hope for military glory was dashed with the signing of the armistice on the day he was due to depart for Europe, and his best girl, Zelda, didn't want to date a pauper. In 1920, however, his luck changed when Scribner bought his first manuscript, This Side of Paradise, and introduced him to the world, which welcomed him warmly. This latest Library of America volume includes that first novel plus several works written during Fitzgerald's younger and more vulnerable years: Flappers and Philosophers (short stories, 1920), The Beautiful and Damned (novel, 1922), and Tales of the Jazz Age (short stories, 1922). The short stories include such gems as "Bernice Bobs Her Hair," "The Ice Palace," and "A Diamond as Big as the Ritz." Though all this material is readily available, and, one hopes, always will be, it's wonderful having Fitzgerald's fledgling works together in a quality hardcover.

Jonathan Eig's masterful narrative revolves around four principal characters: the fiery feminist Margaret Sanger, who was a champion of birth control in her campaign for the rights of women but neglected her own children in pursuit of free love; the beautiful Katharine McCormick, who owed her fortune to her wealthy husband, the son of the founder of International Harvester and a schizophrenic; the visionary scientist Gregory Pincus, who was dismissed by Harvard in the 1930s as a result of his experimentation with <em>in vitro</em> fertilization but who, after he was approached by Sanger and McCormick, grew obsessed with the idea of inventing a drug that could stop ovulation; and the telegenic John Rock, a Catholic doctor from Boston who battled his own church to become an enormously effective advocate in the effort to win public approval for the drug that would be marketed by Searle as Enovid.</p><p>Spanning the years from Sanger&#x2019;s heady Greenwich Village days in the early twentieth century to trial tests in Puerto Rico in the 1950s to the cusp of the sexual revolution in the 1960s, this is a grand story of radical feminist politics, scientific ingenuity, establishment opposition, and, ultimately, a sea change in social attitudes.

King of Vampires. He is Dracula, the most well-known vampire in the world&#x2014;and this new illustrated edition of Bram Stoker&#x2019;s classic tale of terror offers Dracula as you have never seen him before. Brought to life through the stunning visual artistry of Eisner Award-winning illustrator Becky Cloonan (<em>Demo</em>, <em>American Virgin</em>, <em>Victor Von Doom</em>), this new graphically compelling novel offers a spellbinding, edition of the book that launched the world&#x2019;s enduring fascination with vampires: Bram Stoker&#x2019;s complete and unabridged <em>Dracula</em>.

(The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>A Room of One&#x2019;s Own and Three Guineas (Collins Classics)</h2><p><p>HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.</p><p>&#x2018;Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind...&#x2019;</p><p>Based on a lecture given at Cambridge and first published in 1929, &#x2018;A Room of One&#x2019;s Own&#x2019; interweaves Woolf&#x2019;s personal experience as a female writer with themes ranging from Austen and Bront� to Shakespeare&#x2019;s gifted (and imaginary) sister. &#x2018;Three Guineas&#x2019;, Woolf&#x2019;s most impassioned polemic, came almost a decade later and broke new ground by challenging the very notions of war and masculinity.</p><p>This volume combines two inspirational, witty and urbane essays from one of literature&#x2019;s pre-eminent voices; collectively they constitute a brilliant and lucid attack on sexual inequality.</p></p><p><p>&#x2018;Brilliant interweaving of personal experience, imaginative musing and political clarity&#x2019;<br>Kate Mosse</p><p>&#x2018;Achingly relevant&#x2019;<br>Natasha Walter, Guardian</p>Woolf exposes the prejudices and constraints against which women writers struggled for centuries, and argues for a more equal literary establishment</p><h2>Seeking Him: Experiencing the Joy of Personal Revival</h2><p><p><b>OVER 400,000 COPIES SOLD!</b></p><p></p><p>Revival isn&#x2019;t just an emotional experience.

FiRST EDITION. BOOK IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. VERY CLEAN. A HANDBOOK OF ART HITORY. CLICK OUR STORE NAME FOR MORE GREAT BOOKS &amp; CDs.</p><p>Designed as a comprehensive supplement to Janson&#39;s History of Art, Fifth Edition, Hartt&#39;s Art, Fourth Edition, and Gardner&#39;s Art Through the Ages, Ninth Edition -- but also appropriate as a stand-alone brief reference text -- this handbook defines the most common terms used in discussing the history of visual arts.Preface <p> ART must ultimately be explained in terms of art, not art terms. The description of visual form, the definition of stylistic categories, and the decoding of ancient myth and symbol, while fascinating pursuits in their own right, are of greatest value when they are mastered with the aim of comprehending the unique expressive power of individual works of art. This handbook has been prepared with that end in mind. Terminology and iconography have been defined with reference to specific works of art. This is done by keying entries to the splendid collection of over 1,200 reproductions in the sixth edition of H.W and A.F Janson's popular and accessible History of Art. Thus, terms, processes, principles, subjects, and symbols are not only defined verbally but can be studied as they appear in particular contexts and in historical sequence. </p><p> For those who may have Marilyn Stokstad's Art History (revised edition), the fourth edition of Frederick Hartt's Art or the eleventh edition of Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, Gardner's Art through the Ages, a list of identical or similar illustrations in these art history surveys, paralleling those in the sixth edition of Janson's History o f Art, is provided at the very back of this book. By consulting this table of parallel illustrations, most of the Janson figure numbers referred to in the entries in this book can also be located in current editions of Stokstad, Hartt and Gardner. </p><p> The numbers in italics found in the various entries (e.g. 19-25) refer to figure numbers in the sixth edition of Janson's History o f Art; numbers preceded by "fig." refer to the illustrations in this book. Words in italics are cross-references to other entries. If a term is printed in italics, a definition of it will be found in alphabetical order in Chapter One; mythological beings will be found in Chapter Two; the subjects of Christian art, arranged by category, will be found in Chapter Three; saints, in Chapter Four; and Christian signs and symbols, in Chapter Five. </p><p> Following Chapter Five is a chronological list of leading painters, photographers, sculptors, and architects from the fourteenth century to the present. Entries indicate birth and death dates, nationality, customary media employed and places where the artist is known to have worked. An especially useful feature of this list is the simplified phonetic indication of the common pronunciation of the artist's name. Following the Chronology are maps locating art centers commonly mentioned in surveys of art history. Keys to the vast storehouse of digital imagery now available on the internet have been provided in the Directory of Museum Websites preceding the Index. The comprehensive Index not only alphabetically lists all entries from the five chapters but also includes the hundreds of terms defined within the major entries. </p><p> Simplified phonetic pronunciations are provided for unfamiliar names and terms, but they are only approximations of polite usage, introduced to prevent only the most ear-shattering barbarisms. In many cases, other pronunciations are equally acceptable. When a word has been taken over directly from a foreign language, it may usually be given the proper foreign pronunciation without raising too many eyebrows. Thus, "tablinum" (tably'num) may even more "correctly" be pronounced ta-blee'num. In Chapter Four, the English names of saints are followed by their customary Italian, French, Spanish, and German names when the foreign form is markedly different from the English. An explanation of symbols, indicating French and German sounds not used in English, will be found preceding the chronological list of artists. </p><p> I am particularly indebted to Paulette Perone, who helped prepare the original list of entries; Arthur Irwin, who made many of the original architectural drawings; Catherine Hartkopf, who typed the original manuscript; the late H.W: Janson, who kindly consented to read the original manuscript and gave me the benefit of his wise counsel; and all those students at Case-Western Reserve University, the University of Kentucky, Dartmouth College, and Colby College, who, over the years, insisted that I define my terms.</p><p>J.S.P.</p></p><h2>Aion (Collected Works of C. G. Jung)</h2><p><p><em>Aion</em> is one of a number of major works that Jung wrote during his seventies that were concerned with the relations between psychology, alchemy and religion.</p> <p>He is particularly concerned in this volume with the rise of Christianity and with the figure of Christ. He explores how Christianity came about when it did, the importance of the figure of Christ and the identification of the figure of Christ with the archetype of the Self. A matter of special importance to Jung in his seventies - the problem of opposites, particularly good and evil - is further discussed and the importance of the symbolism of the fish, which recurs as a symbol of both Christ and the devil, is examined.</p> <p>As a study of the archetype of the self, <em>Aion</em> complements <em>The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious</em>, which is also published in paperback.</p></p><p></p><h2>C�sar&#x2019;s Calendar: Ancient Time and the Beginnings of History</h2><p>The ancient Romans changed more than the map of the world when they conquered so much of it; they altered the way historical time itself is marked and understood. In this brilliant, erudite, and exhilarating book Denis Feeney investigates time and its contours as described by the ancient Romans, first as Rome positioned itself in relation to Greece and then as it exerted its influence as a major world power. Feeney welcomes the reader into a world where time was movable and changeable and where simply ascertaining a date required a complex and often contentious cultural narrative. In a style that is lucid, fluent, and graceful, he investigates the pertinent systems, including the Roman calendar (which is still our calendar) and its near perfect method of capturing the progress of natural time; the annual rhythm of consular government; the plotting of sacred time onto sacred space; the forging of chronological links to the past; and, above all, the experience of empire, by which the Romans meshed the city state&#x2019;s concept of time with those of the foreigners they encountered to establish a new worldwide web of time. Because this web of time was Greek before the Romans transformed it, the book is also a remarkable study in the cross-cultural interaction between the Greek and Roman worlds.<br><br>Feeney&#x2019;s skillful deployment of specialist material is engaging and accessible and ranges from details of the time schemes used by Greeks and Romans to accommodate the Romans&#x2019; unprecedented rise to world dominance to an edifying discussion of the fixed axis of B.C./A.D., or B.C.E./C.E., and the supposedly objective dates&#x201d; implied. He closely examines the most important of the ancient world&#x2019;s time divisions, that between myth and history, and concludes by demonstrating the impact of the reformed calendar on the way the Romans conceived of time&#x2019;s recurrence. Feeney&#x2019;s achievement is nothing less than the reconstruction of the Roman conception of time, which has the additional effect of transforming the way the way the reader inhabits and experiences time.</p><p>"Among the many great strengths of Feeney's <i>Caesar's Calendar</i> are the ease and elegance with which the author makes an enormous amount of specialized material accessible to a wide audience and engages strikingly with ancient and modern science and non-classical cultural studies as well as with current trends in classical scholarship."&#x2014;Donald Mastronarde, author of <i>Euripides: Medea</i><br><br>"Extraordinarily ambitious and brilliantly realized."&#x2014;Ellen Oliensis, author of <i>Horace and the Rhetoric of Authority</i><b>Denis Feeney</b> is Giger Professor of Latin at Princeton University and was the 2004 Sather Lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley.

She writes of the world's beauty, but fears that it may be deceptive, even deadly. She is a religious poet, but much of her work is driven by uncertainty. Her poems are restrained, even secretive, but they seek nothing less than the mystery of Life and Death.<br> <br>This edition contains Rossetti's strongest and most distinctive work: poetry (including 'Goblin Market', 'The Prince's Progress', and the sonnet sequence 'Monna Innominata'), stories (including the complete text of <em>Maude</em>), devotional prose (with nearly fifty entries from the 'reading diary' <em>Times</em> <em>Flies</em>), and personal letters. Those poems which Rossetti published, and those which she withheld from publication, are here brought together in chronological order, allowing the reader to observe her poetic trajectory. This edition also records the major revisions made by Rossetti when preparing her poems for publication. It brings together the fullest range of Rossetti's poetry and prose in one volume, and is an indispensable introduction to this entrancing writer.<br><strong></strong> About the Series: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

These important movements are included, but this text also covers historical debates about religious language along with several other contemporary movements that have had increasing impact upon biblical studies and theology, such as hermeneutical philosophy, philosophy of metaphor, narrative, structuralism, and poststructuralism.</p> <p><i>The Philosophy of Religious Language</i> focuses on exposition of the different approaches, with attention upon central thinkers and texts. In each case, however, the philosophy of language is also connected with its major appropriation in religious studies. Since one cannot exactly keep these approaches distinct, places of cross-fertilization and reaction are indicated, with the intent of providing an expanding conversation as the book progresses.</p><b>Dan Stiver</b> is Associate Professor of Religious Philosophy at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville.</p><h2>Willy Pog�ny Rediscovered</h2><p>Famed in the early twentieth century for his Art Nouveau&#x2013;style depictions of episodes from mythology, Willy Pog�ny illustrated books for readers of all ages.

Recognizing the professional expertise of classroom teachers, the authors consistently urge teachers to consider the suggested plan in relation to their children's spelling needs. Children are actively engaged in spelling explorations, being guided by their teachers, forming generalizations that reflect their current understanding about how written English works. Specific suggestions are also offered for children whose first language is not English. <em>Spelling K-8</em> addresses the issues that administrators and parents are concerned about - especially phonics and learning high-frequency words - and offers teachers a wealth of strategies and resources to draw on.</p><p><em>Spelling K-8</em> assists teachers in:understanding current beliefs about teaching and learning and means of translating these into classroom practice;implementing specific types of spelling investigations, such as sounds, spelling patterns or suffixes, by clearly outlining the general process involved in spelling explorations;identifying the possible spelling focuses for children in each grade level, taking into consideration their needs and the explorations they have been introduced to in previous years;relating the teaching of spelling to reading and writing experiences in a variety of curriculum areas;knowing the generalizations children need to learn to enable them to understand how written English works.</p><p><em>Spelling K-8</em> will help you plan the teaching of spelling at a whole-school level and at each grade level.</p></p><p><p>Diane hails from Australia and travels a lot between her home and New York.

Stephen Miller suggests that someone rewrote Shakespeare&#39;s more complicated version, making it shorter, simpler and different in some ways. The main difference between the two plays concerns the framing story of Christopher Sly, the drunk, who disappears early on in Shakespeare&#39;s version, but who has a much larger role in A Shrew.This edition provides a modernised text and extensive commentary.An exciting new edition of the complete works of Shakespeare with these features: Illustrated with photographs from New York Shakespeare Festival productions, vivid readable readable introductions for each play by noted scholar David Bevington, a lively personal foreword by Joseph Papp, an insightful essay on the play in performance, modern spelling and pronunciation, up-to-date annotated bibliographies, and convenient listing of key passages.</p><h2>Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C.</h2><p><p>This important volume describes the extraordinary art created in the second millennium B.C. for royal palaces, temples, and tombs from Mesopotamia, Syria, and Anatolia to Cyprus, Egypt, and the Aegean. &nbsp;Objects of the highest artistry reflect the development of a sophisticated trade network throughout the eastern Mediterranean region and the resulting fusion of Near Eastern, Aegean, and Egyptian cultural styles.</p><p>The impact of these far-flung connections is documented in the precious materials sent to royal and temple treasuries and, most dramatically, in objects discovered on merchant shipwrecks off the shores of southern Anatolia. The history of the period and the artistic creativity fostered by interaction among the powers of the ancient Near East, both great and small, are discussed by an international group of scholars in essays and entries on the more than 350 objects included in the exhibition, continuing the fascinating story begun in the landmark catalogue <i>Art of the First Cities</i> (2003).</p></p><p>Joan Aruz is Curator in Charge and Kim Benzel and Jean Evans are Assistant Curators in the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&#x201c;. . .&nbsp;an impressive volume&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;The text is erudite and the subjects examined in depth, while the photographs superbly show the stunning art works&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;the publishers are to be congratulated on producing such a sumptuous volume.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Spence, <i>Gazette and Herald (Ryedale and Scarborough)</i><br> (Bill Spence <i>Gazette and Herald (Ryedale and Scarborough)</i> 2009-02-18)</p><h2>Precision and Soul: Essays and Addresses</h2><p><p>"We do not have too much intellect and too little soul, but too little precision in matters of the soul."&#x2014;Robert Musil<br> <br> Best known as author of the novel <i>The Man without Qualities,</i> Robert Musil wrote these essays in Vienna and Berlin between 1911 and 1937. Offering a perspective on modern society and intellectual life, they are concerned with the crisis of modern culture as it manifests itself in science and mathematics, capitalism and nationalism, the changing roles of women and writers, and more. Writing to find his way in a world where moral systems everywhere were seemingly in decay, Musil strives to reconcile the ongoing conflict between functional relativism and the passionate search for ethical values.<br> <br> Robert Musil was born in 1880 and died in 1942.

Looking beyond the conventional answers&#x2015;for the sake of truth, beauty, and practical applications&#x2015;this book offers an eclectic panorama of the lives and values and hopes and fears of mathematicians in the twenty-first century, assembling material from a startlingly diverse assortment of scholarly, journalistic, and pop culture sources.</p><p>Drawing on his personal experiences and obsessions as well as the thoughts and opinions of mathematicians from Archimedes and Omar Khayy�m to such contemporary giants as Alexander Grothendieck and Robert Langlands, Michael Harris reveals the charisma and romance of mathematics as well as its darker side. In this portrait of mathematics as a community united around a set of common intellectual, ethical, and existential challenges, he touches on a wide variety of questions, such as: Are mathematicians to blame for the 2008 financial crisis? How can we talk about the ideas we were born too soon to understand? And how should you react if you are asked to explain number theory at a dinner party?</p><p>Disarmingly candid, relentlessly intelligent, and richly entertaining, <i>Mathematics without Apologies</i> takes readers on an unapologetic guided tour of the mathematical life, from the philosophy and sociology of mathematics to its reflections in film and popular music, with detours through the mathematical and mystical traditions of Russia, India, medieval Islam, the Bronx, and beyond.</p></p><p><p>"Harris's book is a wonderfully accomplished mix of many things: an auto-ethnography of a charismatic mathematician; an extended conversation regarding beauty, truth, and the good in pure mathematics; a reflection on the doing and practice of it; and an unapologetic embrace of the playfulness of mathematical thought."<b>--Brian Rotman, professor emeritus, Ohio State University</b></p><p>"Michael Harris writes with all-absorbing exuberance and intensity about what it feels like from the inside to do mathematics, and he succeeds, for the uninitiated like myself, in conveying the motives and the pleasure that have impelled him and his precursors and peers to seek to understand. But <i>Mathematics without Apologies</i> is many things besides: it combines thoughtful personal memoir, sharp social chronicle, entertaining literary analysis, and jeux d'esprit reflecting on formulae for love or on the hidden structures in the fiction of Thomas Pynchon. Most importantly, however, Harris issues a clarion call for the autonomy of research in our time. He defends--fiercely and lucidly--the pursuit of understanding without recourse to commercial interests or other principles of utility. This is an original and passionate book; Michael Harris has fashioned much-needed luminous arguments for the cause of intellectual independence."<b>--Marina Warner, professor of English and creative writing, Birkbeck, University of London, and author of <i>Stranger Magic: Charmed States and the Arabian Nights</i></b></p><p>"Michael Harris opens the doors and gently guides you into a magic world. Once inside, you can't help but feel mesmerized, eager to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. And no wonder: a major thinker of our time is talking to you about math and so much more, like you've never heard before."<b>--Edward Frenkel, author of <i>Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality</i></b></p><p>"Here is a quilted book about mathematical practice, each patch wonderfully prepared. Part invitation to number theory, part autobiography, part sociology of mathematical training, Mathematics without Apologies brings us into contemporary mathematics as a living, active inquiry by real people. Anyone wanting a varied, cultured, and penetrating view of today's mathematics could find no better place to engage."<b>--Peter Galison, author of <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps: Empires of Time</i></b></p><p>"In <i>Mathematics without Apologies</i>, an important mathematician reports to outsiders straight from the frontier of knowledge. Alternating chapters of more traditional popularization with a sophisticated essayistic discourse that naturally blends the historical, the autobiographical, and the philosophical, Michael Harris manages to convey the complexity, the magic, and the near-mystical quality of modern mathematical research."<b>--Apostolos Doxiadis, coauthor of <i>Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth</i> and author of <i>Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture: A Novel of Mathematical Obsession</i></b></p><p>"<i>Mathematics without Apologies</i> is a math book like no other. Harris mixes number theory, literary criticism, and philosophy into a powerful meditation on mathematics as it is really practiced, vaporizing all cliches and romantic myths within his astoundingly broad reach."<b>--Jordan Ellenberg, author of <i>How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</i></b></p><p>"Becoming a mathematician is like becoming a musician. The apprentice must master the technique, but along the way he also has to develop an aesthetic sense. Only then can he become a master in his own right. In this lively book, Harris examines the mathematician's craft from every angle, from the elementary and familiar to the sophisticated and exotic, and questions the ethics of using mathematics in finance. <i>Mathematics without Apologies</i> is a very personal book dealing with timeless questions."<b>--Ivar Ekeland, mathematician and economist, author of <i>The Best of All Possible Worlds</i> and <i>The Cat in Numberland</i></b></p><p>"As the only child of John von Neumann, I have long tried to understand what it is that mathematicians do. Michael Harris addresses the question from every angle. I still don't have a complete handle on the answer, but I'm certainly puzzled at a much higher level than before."<b>--Marina von Neumann Whitman, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"Harris offers a unique and passionate view of the life and work of contemporary mathematicians. Rich in detail and marvelously broad in scope, <i>Mathematics without Apologies</i> gives an unforgettable account of the frustrations, elations, and sheer wonder of doing mathematics."<b>--Barry Mazur, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Mathematical high culture collides with pop culture and all hell breaks loose! Harris takes us on a wild ride--never a dull moment!"<b>--Gregory Chaitin, author of <i>Proving Darwin: Making Biology Mathematical</i></b></p><p>"<i>Mathematics without Apologies</i> is a work of relentless intelligence that depicts Harris's experience of mathematics, but it is not at all a mathematician's autobiography. It is a madly erudite and creative reflection on the mathematical life."<b>--Colin McLarty, author of <i>Elementary Categories, Elementary Toposes</i></b></p><p>"Harris vividly conveys what it is to work as a researcher in pure mathematics today. Through a series of novel and unexpected perspectives, he transforms readers' preconceptions of this activity. What we encounter here are the reflections of an erudite mathematician, uncommonly well read outside his field, on the nature and purpose of his subject."<b>--David Corfield, author of <i>Towards a Philosophy of Real Mathematics</i></b></p><b>Michael Harris</b> is professor of mathematics at the Universit� Paris Diderot and Columbia University. He is the author or coauthor of more than seventy mathematical books and articles, and has received a number of prizes, including the Clay Research Award, which he shared in 2007 with Richard Taylor.</p><h2>Masters</h2><p>Sixteen contemporary writers reminisce about the teachers who had the most significant effect on their own minds and work, yielding insight into the thought and personality of such incisive thinkers as Yvor Winters, Hannah Arendt, and J.

His explanation of the role of natural selection in driving the evolution of life on earth depended on steady variation of living things over time &#x2013; but he was unable to explain how this variation occurred. In the 150 years since publication of the Origin of Species, we have discovered three main sources for this variation &#x2013; mutation, hybridisation and epigenetics. Then on Sunday, 12th February, 2001 the evidence for perhaps the most extraordinary cause of variation was simultaneously released by two organisations &#x2013; the code for the entire human genome. Not only was the human genome unbelievably simple (it is only ten times more complicated than a bacteria), but embedded in the code were large fragments that were derived from viruses &#x2013; fragments that were vital to evolution of all organisms and the evidence for a fourth and vital source of variation &#x2013; viruses.</p><p>Virolution is the product of Dr Frank Ryan's decade of research at the frontiers of this new science &#x2013; now called viral symbiosis &#x2013; and the amazing revolution that it has had in these few years. As scientists begin to look for evidence of viral involvement in more and more processes, they have discovered that they are vital in nearly every case. And with this understanding comes the possibility of manipulating the role of the viruses to help fight a huge range of diseases.</p></p><p><p>Frank Ryan is a consultant physician based in Sheffield, and an honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield. He is also an international best-selling writer. His book, Tuberculosis: The Greatest Story Never Told, was a New York Times Book of the Year while Darwin's Blind Spot was the 'Amazon Featured Book' recommended by Charlie Munger at the 2003 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.

This remarkable book reveals the hidden meaning behind familiar images and words, from the origins of Santa Claus and the meaning of Cinderella's name to the metaphoric significance of the unicorn and the fleur-de-lys.<br>A prominent authority on symbols, author Harold Bayley spent years gathering and compiling the contents of this volume. Mythology, folklore, religious texts, and fairy tales from around the world constitute his primary sources. Bayley also draws upon the secret traditions of ancient cultures and medieval mystical sects to deconstruct the symbols embedded in watermarks and printers' emblems. Most of these images have lost their earliest significance and now serve strictly commercial purposes; Bayley explains their original meanings, and he cross-references similarities between symbols and stories across the globe to illuminate their evolving cultural significance. More than 1,400 illustrations enhance this classic work, which features an index for ease of reference.</p><p></p><h2>Spreadsheet Modeling and Decision Analysis: A Practical Introduction to Business Analytics</h2><p>SPREADSHEET MODELING AND DECISION ANALYSIS, Seventh Edition, provides instruction in the most commonly used management science techniques and shows how these tools can be implemented using Microsoft Office Excel 2013.</p><p>A recognized innovator in spreadsheet instruction and highly regarded pioneer in business analytics, Dr. Cliff Ragsdale is the Bank of America Professor of Business Information Technology and Academic Director of the Center for Business Intelligence and Analytics in the Pamplin College of Business at Virginia Tech, where he has taught since 1990.

Providing a highly informative integration of science and practice, chapters are written by the leading experts on CBT. This volume is a 'must read' for psychotherapy students being introduced to CBT and for practitioners who need a concise, balanced, and informative review of the latest advances."--David A. Clark, PhD, Department of Psychology (Emeritus), University of New Brunswick, Canada<br><br> "Even seasoned clinicians would benefit from reading this volume, which reviews CBT's roots and presents current thinking from top practitioners and researchers. Chapters thoroughly introduce cognitive and behavioral methods and provide detailed descriptions of the most prominent therapies. Unlike other CBT books that are organized around specific diagnoses, this book disentangles the treatments from the disorders. Its special strength lies in its broader focus on the processes involved in delivering the very best CBT interventions."--Jerusha Detweiler-Bedell, PhD, Department of Psychology, Lewis &amp; Clark College<br><br> "The large body of research testing the effectiveness of CBT is one of the field's strengths. In this volume, Dobson and his colleagues offer an up-to-date, detailed review of CBT research and practice, including valuable new chapters. This volume is an excellent text for graduate courses and will provide clinicians with up-to-date coverage of clinical techniques and their empirical bases."--James Pretzer, PhD, Director, Cleveland Center for Cognitive Therapy<br><br> "This extremely well-written volume provides sophisticated coverage of the broad array of cognitive-behavioral therapies. It begins by reviewing the many different strands of CBT and the findings from treatment outcome studies, and offers excellent discussions of case conceptualization and cognitive assessment. These introductory sections form a strong base for chapters on the theory and techniques of the various CBT approaches. Unique strengths include the book's transdiagnostic approach to treatment, its cutting-edge coverage of cognitive science, and the chapters on newer therapies. Highly recommended as a graduate psychotherapy text."--Sheri L. Johnson, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"Dobson's revision of this classic volume provides a solid resource for psychologists and students of psychology. Many of us find that we become highly focused on our specific clinical work, teaching, and research, and it is easy to feel out of touch with the broader developments in the field. It is very helpful to pick up a resource such as this one to remind ourselves of the bigger picture in this important and influential treatment approach. Dobson has chosen authors for each topic who are key figures in the development of the approaches covered in their chapters. This choice of authors shows in the quality of the presentations and the familiarity with the key issues in each area....Will be very useful in graduate courses on CBT and in settings where clinical students are supervised. Practitioners and students with an interest in CBT will find it very helpful as a guide to the broad range of approaches and issues in CBT."

This informative guide decodes these often-mysterious scenes and reveals a vibrant world of images from the Christian tradition for museum visitors, students, and art enthusiasts alike.<br> <em>Gospel Figures in Art</em> examines depictions of stories and figures from both the New Testament's canonical gospels (the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) and the apocryphal gospels (early Christian writings excluded from the New Testament because of their unsubstantiated authorship), which served as rich sources of inspiration for medieval and Renaissance artists. Illustrated with masterpieces from many of the world's premier museums, the art works provided as visual references are carefully analyzed. Sections are devoted to the principal figures in the life of Jesus Christ-his family and the evangelists-and to the major biographical turning points: his birth and baptism, his public life, the miracles and good deeds he performed, his crucifixion, resurrection, and the events that followed. This indispensable resource makes the icons and narratives of sacred art come to life.</p><p>Following the basic sequence of events in the New Testament, from the Immaculate Conception to the Resurrection, this valuable handbook offers a plethora of illustrations and, uniquely, diagrams of biblical art, with detailed identifications of even obscure figures and explanations of particular symbols. Mary's loose and long hair demonstrates her virginity, even at the end of her life. Reeds, loosely tied in cross shape, held innocently by toddler Christ, hint at the sorrow to come. Zuffi (Art in Venice) does not hesitate to illustrate the human side of the gospel figures, frequently interpreting body postures and facial expressions. In one 1330 painting, Mary leans slightly backward while nursing the infant Christ, a pose that "derive[s], not from some fixed and unchangeable stereotype, but from a direct vision of reality." The reproductions are often set within the artist's own landscape, with biblical cities such as Jerusalem or Bethlehem resembling an Italian hill town or snowy Dutch village, and sometimes even the artist himself (or the wealthy patron of his work) appears. Terrifically executed, this is a unique book that will enrich viewers' experiences of the art. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Birds</h2><p><i>Scarlet macaws weave in and out of the rainforest canopy...<br><br>The elegant silhouette of a Kori bustard appears ont he African savanna...<br><br></i>Internationally acclaimed wildlife artist and naturalist Robert Bateman has sketched and painted bird life in every corner of the globe. And a lifetime of observing an extraordinary range of species has given him a wealth of knowledge about bird habitats, behavior, and survival skills. Now, in this unique volume, Robert Bateman's newest paintings are combined with his insightful reflections on bird life in splendid pages that will delight nature and art lovers alike.<br><br>This personal birding odyssey begins atBateman's easel on an island off Canada's Pacific coast, where herons, kingfishers, and bald eagles pass by his studio windows. From there it proceeds to a variety of North American destinations ranging from a seabird colony on Alaska's Pribil of Islands to the waterways of Florida's Everglades. Bateman has also explored many international wildlife sanctuaries and his unforgetttable experiences there are re-created in evocative color painting and vivid first-person recollections.<br><br>Lavishly illustrated and informatively written, <i>Birds </i>is an intimate appreciation of some of the planet's most beautiful and fascinating creatures by an artist who has been capturing them on canvas for over forty years.</p><p>World renowned wildlife painter Bateman (Thinking Like a Mountain) describes this book as neither a field guide to birds nor a reference book. Rather it is aptly represented as an artist's "portfolio" and a "field diary." Bateman not only depicts a worldwide range of avian species in startlingly lifelike paintings, he also captures a sense of place and motion (even when the subjects are still) within landscapes that could stand on their own. The artist's uncanny ability is no less displayed in the backgrounds and settings than in the portraits of the birds. Bateman paints a wading African blue crane with both bird and water in near photographic clarity. Likewise, he crafts a muted impressionistic Latin American rain forest, wherein brilliantly colored macaws perch, preen and dangle from the lush trees. Perhaps because of the voluptuousness of the paintings, Dean's text, depicting Bateman's field experiences, leans toward breathless overuse of modifiers, rather than lighter, subtler prose; the brief foreword to the book by Matthiessen (Birds of Heaven) is insightful. Yet the paintings easily carry the accompanying top-heavy copy with no ill effect. This is a wonderful book for birders, wildlife enthusiasts and art lovers.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.It's hard to overuse superlatives when discussing the paintings of Robert Bateman. Truly one of the great living artists, his skill at depicting wildlife, particularly birds, is legendary. Inspired by nature at an early age, Bateman was later influenced by the work of Andrew Wyeth. <i>Birds</i> is a personal tour of the planet's avian denizens as the artist paints species he has seen in his travels from his home base in Canada to the Southwest, the Everglades, Europe, India, Africa, and the Antarctic. Bateman's skills with brush, pencil, and ink are stunningly displayed here, including both field sketches and finished works. The artist's commentary accompanies each piece, imparting notes about the natural history of each bird as well as comments about how or why he painted it. Bateman's evocative use of negative space highlights the subject, and details such as the species of plant or the type of rock used as a perch define the bird's habitat. Despite its price, this book is a bargain and belongs in every library. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Based on Mao's own experiences in fighting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists and his interpretations of the classic strategies of Sun-tzu, <i>On Guerrilla Warfare</i> outlines the tactics that have proven effective around the world, from Vietnamese jungles to Middle Eastern deserts.<br>Prescient in his thinking and concise in his expression, Mao conceived of guerrilla operations as a complement to traditional warfare. He explains why guerrilla activities should be integrated into conventional military procedures and discusses the organization and operation of guerrilla units. His unorthodox strategies transform disadvantages into benefits: using retreat as an offensive maneuver; indoctrinating locals for employment as spies; and compensating for lack of firepower with speed, surprise, and initiative.<br>Translator Samuel B. Griffith provides a comprehensive introduction in which he profiles Mao, examines the nature and conduct of guerrilla warfare, and considers the implications of such warfare for American policy.</p><p>Mao Zedong or Mao Tse-tung; December 26, 1893 &#x2013; September 9, 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary, poet, political theorist and founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he governed as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949, until his death in 1976. His Marxist&#x2013;Leninist theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Born the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism&#x2013;Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937&#x2013;45), after Japan's defeat, China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan. On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a one-party state controlled by the CPC. In the following years Mao solidified his control through a campaign of classicide against landlords,[1] and a mass purge of perceived enemies of the state he termed "counterrevolutionaries" alleged to have caused between 2,000,000[2] to 6,000,000deaths. (Mao himself admitting 800,000 deaths in the classicide and 712,000 in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries). In 1957, he launched the Great Leap Forward campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. The campaign contributed to a widespread famine, whose death toll is estimated at between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000. In 1966, he initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a program to remove "counterrevolutionary" elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle that killed 400,000 to 10,000,000 people and caused widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's personality cult.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Winning on Appeal: Better Briefs &amp; Oral Argument</h2><p>Since it was first published over a decade ago, Winning on Appeal has been adopted by top-flight law schools for appellate advocacy courses. It also has become a popular desk reference on how to write an effective brief and deliver a persuasive oral argument. In this long-awaited Second Edition, Ruggero J. Aldisert, a forty-year veteran of the federal appeals bench, fundamentally reorganizes the book. By creating twenty-five chapters in place of the previous seventeen, Aldisert creates a wonderfully instructive how-to manual for the appellate advocate and a must volume for those who select appellate advocates. <p>In the Second Edition, Part 1, "The Theory and Criticisms of Written and Oral Appellate Advocacy," retains the same format as the earlier editions except that the tables of statistics are updated. The book continues its unique approach by consolidating current empirical data on the odds of prevailing on appeal or having a case orally argued. Part 2, "Technical Requirements for Briefs" contains a chapter on jurisdiction as well as a chapter on issue preservation and standards of review. </p><p>The major revisions to the Second Edition appear in Part 3 and Part 4. Aldisert designed the chapters in these sections to identify discrete requirements for an effective brief or argument, and to explain how to meet these prerequisites. Chapter 23, "How Top-Flight Appellate Lawyers Prepare" is new to the Second Edition. This chapter contains advice from outstanding appellate lawyers, true masters in oral advocacy, on how to prepare for oral argument. </p><p>Throughout the Second Edition of Winning on Appeal, nineteen current chief justices of state courts, nine chief judges of U.S. Courts of Appeals, more than twenty U.S. Circuit judges, and state appellate judges contribute their thoughts on how to write a brief and how to argue a case-information that is not available in any other publication or resource. </p><p>From cover to cover, Winning on Appeal is the quintessential handbook on how to write a brief and argue an appeal. Like removing the back of a watch to see what makes it tick, this book looks behind the bench in appellate courtrooms and behind chambers&#x2019; doors to expose exactly what the judges want to read and hear from lawyers. In an easy-to-read style, Judge Aldisert draws the perfect roadmap for the attorney who wants to win on appeal.</p></p><p>Aldisert is a Senior United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.Hon. Ruggero J. Aldisert, a prominent author and teacher, has been a U.S. Circuit Judge for 35 years. He took senior status in 1987, and continues to sit frequently with the Third Circuit and, by designation, with other U.S. Courts of Appeals. His books include Logic for Lawyers: A Guide to Clear Legal Thinking (NITA 1997), a guide to using legal reasoning to persuade judges and juries; Winning on Appeal: Better Briefs and Oral Argument (NITA 1996), one of the best texts available on the practical aspects of presenting an appeal; the leading treatise, The Judicial Process (1996), now in its second edition; and the leading text on opinion writing for judges, Opinion Writing (1990). <p>Judge Aldisert was adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School for 20 years and was a longtime seminar leader for newly selected U.S. Circuit Judges and State Supreme Court Justices.</p></p><h2>Thank You, St. Jude: Women&#39;s Devotion to the Patron Saint of Hopeless Causes</h2><p>St. Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes, is the most popular saint of the American Catholic laity, particularly among women. This fascinating book describes how the cult of St. Jude originated in 1929, traces the rise in Jude's popularity over the next decades, and investigates the circumstances that led so many Catholic women to feel hopeless and to turn to St. Jude for help. <br><br>Robert A. Orsi tells us that the women who were drawn to St. Jude&#x2015;daughters and granddaughters of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and Ireland&#x2015;were the first generations of Catholic women to make lives for themselves outside of their ethnic enclaves. Orsi explores the ambitions and dilemmas of these women as they dealt with the pressures of the Depression and the Second World War, made modern marriages for themselves, entered the workplace, took care of relatives in their old neighborhoods, and raised children in circumstances very different from those of their mothers and grandmothers. Drawing on testimonies written in the periodicals devoted to St. Jude and on interviews with women who felt their lives were changed by St. Jude's intervention, Orsi shows how devotion to St. Jude enabled these women to negotiate their way amid the conflicting expectations of their two cultures&#x2015;American and Catholic.</p><p><b>Robert A.

With <i>Perception, Cognition, and Decision Training: The Quiet Eye in Action</i>, readers gain access to the research foundations behind an innovative decision-training system that has been used successfully for years in training athletes. </p><p>Certain to become the definitive guide to decision making in sport, this text presents three innovations solidly based in research. The first is the vision-in-action method of recording what athletes actually see when they perform. The second is the quiet eye phenomenon that has attracted considerable media attention. The third innovation is decision training to identify not only how athletes make performance decisions but also how to facilitate visual perception and action to enhance performance. Author Joan Vickers--who discovered the quiet eye and developed the vision-in-action method--takes the next step by integrating all three innovations into a system for helping athletes improve. Together, these advances provide scientific evidence of the effectiveness of perception-action coupling in athletes' training. </p><p><i>Perception, Cognition, and Decision Training: The Quiet Eye in Action</i> is applied to a variety of sports and settings through a three-step decision-training model and seven ready-to-use tools for encouraging athletes to become part of the decision-training process. These tools are research-based concepts that coaches can choose from in order to help train athletes on a specific decision-making task in a simulated competition context. The book also uses these features: </p><p><br>-Informative chapter-opening items provide an overview of the content, and special sections recap the previous chapter and introduce the next.</p><p>-Screen captures from the latest in eye-tracking technology show what athletes actually see, where their eyes are directed, and how their gaze differs depending on their ability level.</p><p>-Boldfaced key terms and a thorough glossary make it easy to identify key concepts in this emerging field of study.</p><p>-Chapter-closing in-action sections provide an opportunity to visit Web sites, read articles, or complete tasks to discover how the concepts learned can be applied.</p><p>-Case studies show how coaches and athletes in various sports have successfully used gaze control and decision training.<br>The book is organized into three parts. <b>Part I</b> introduces the visuomotor system and two processing systems that work together to permit the great range of actions humans perform. Eye-tracking technology is reviewed along with new possibilities for measuring what athletes really see when they perform. In <b>part II</b>, the author presents a unique framework of gaze control. Readers will learn how skilled athletes control the gaze to gain optimal control of their attention and decision making. The quiet eye phenomenon, measurement, and training are also addressed. <br><b>Part III</b> describes the three-step decision-training model and its application to how coaches design practice, provide feedback, use questions, and give instructions. Case studies show how others are using the model and the seven decision-training tools. </p><p>Decision training is designed to improve athletes' attention, anticipation, concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills, leading to extraordinary long-term gains. The cutting-edge research presented in this book allows readers to appreciate the growing importance of cognition, vision, and decision making; it also shows them how to apply this knowledge to sport training and coaching.<br></p></p><p><p><b>Joan N. Vickers, PhD, </b> is a researcher who has been conducting research in gaze control and motor behavior in sport since 1980. From her research, she originated the vision-in-action method, discovered the quiet eye, and developed decision training. Vickers' work has been featured on CNN, with Alan Alda on PBS, and in <i>Golf Digest</i>. She is currently a kinesiology professor at the University of Calgary where she also provides decision training as a professional certification. </p><p>Dr. Vickers previously wrote <i>Instructional Design for Teaching Physical Activity</i>, is a reviewer for many journals, and is a member of the North American Society for Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity (NASPSPA) and other professional organizations.

It includes a complete record of the &#34;lost&#34; eighteen years of his life, a time about which the New Testament is strangely silent. During this period Jesus traveled in India, Tibet, Persia, Egypt and Greece, learning from the Masters, seers and wise men of the East and the West in their temples and schools. Included in this amazing book is information on the Council of the Seven Sages of the World, the meeting of Jesus with the Chinese Master Mencius (Meng Tzu) in Tibet, and the ministry, trial, execution and resurrection of Jesus.</p><p>LEVI (Levi H. Dowling) was born May 18, 1844 in Belleville, Ohio. His father, of Scotch-Welsh descent, was a pioneer preacher among the Disciples of Christ. Levi, following in his father s footsteps, began preaching at the age of sixteen; and at the age of eighteen was pastor of a small church. He entered the US Army as a Chaplain and served in this capacity to the end of the Civil War. By 1866 he was a student at Northwestern Christian University in Indianapolis, Indiana where he soon began publishing Sunday School literature. After graduation, he studied at two medical colleges and went on to practice medicine for a number of years. After his retirement from medicine in the early 1900 s, Levi resumed his literary work and began to organize THE AQUARIAN GOSPEL OF JESUS THE CHRIST for publication. Levi passed from earth-life on August 13, 1911.<p>Table of Contents</p><p>Title Page</p><p>Copyright Page</p><p>Introduction</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ</p><p>Section I.

DOWLING (1844-1911), who originally composed and published this book under the sole name of Levi, was a Church of Christ pastor, a Civil War chaplain for the Union Army, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, a New Thought lecturer, and a religious publisher with an extraordinary vision of unity at the heart of the world&#x2019;s historic religions.</p><p>Dowling said he received the text of <i>The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ</i> while in a trance state, in which he was able to gain access to the &#x201c;Akashic Records.&#x201d; To Dowling, these ethereal records were a cosmic ledger of all human actions. The concept of Akasha, or universal ether, originated in ancient Vedic literature and was popularized in the West in the late nineteenth century through the Theosophical writings of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.</p><p>Dowling copyrighted <i>The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ</i> in 1908 and, with his wife, Eva, began privately selling it the following year. The present volume is based on a 1911 edition, one of the earliest extant versions.</p><p>For ease of reading, this Tarcher Cornerstone Edition of the narrative has been reset and reformatted. It is otherwise unabridged from Dowling&#x2019;s original.</p><p><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p><p>BY EVA S . DOWLING, A . PH.D. , scribe TO THE messenger.</p><p><i>The Book.</i></p><p>The full title of this book is &#x201c;The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus, the Christ of the Piscean Age,&#x201d; and the critical reader is apt to ask a number of pertinent questions concerning it. Among the many anticipated questions these are perhaps the most important:</p><p>1. What is an Age?</p><p>2. What is the Piscean Age?</p><p>3. What is the Aquarian Age?</p><p>4. What is meant by the Christ as the word is used in this book?</p><p>5. What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?</p><p>6. Who is Levi, the transcriber of this book?</p><p>7. What are the Akashic Records?</p><p></p><p><i><b>1.</b> What is an Age?</i> Astronomers tell us that our sun and his family of planets revolve around a central sun, which is millions of miles distant, and that it requires something less than 26,000 years to make one revolution. His orbit is called the Zodiac, which is divided into twelve signs, familiarly known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. It requires our Solar System a little more than 2,100 years to pass through one of these signs, and this time is the measurement of an Age or Dispensation. Because of what Astronomers call &#x201c;the precession of the Equinoxes&#x201d; the movement of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac is in order reverse from that given above.</p><p><i>Exact Time of the Beginning of an Age</i>. Regarding this matter there is a disagreement among astronomers; but in this Introduction we are not called upon to give the reasons of the various investigators for their opinions; there are enough well authenticated facts for our present purposes. It is conceded by all critical students that the sun entered the zodiacal sign Taurus in the days of our historic Adam when the Taurian Age began; that Abraham lived not far from the beginning of the Arian Age, when the sun entered the sign Aries. About the time of the rise of the Roman empire the sun entered the sign Pisces, the Fishes, and the Piscean Age began, so that early in this Age Jesus of Nazareth lived.</p><p><i><b>2.</b> What is the Piscean Age?</i> This question requires further consideration. The Piscean Age is identical with the Christian Dispensation. The word Pisces means fish. The sign is known as a water sign, and the Piscean Age has been distinctly the age of the fish and its element, water.</p><p>In the establishment of their great institutions John the Harbinger and Jesus both introduced the rite of water baptism, which has been used in some form in all the so-called Christian Churches and cults, even to the present time. Water is the true symbol of purification. Jesus himself said to the Harbinger before he was baptized: &#x201c;All men must be washed, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul.&#x201d; (Aquarian Gospel 64:7.)</p><p><i>Fish was a Christian Symbol</i>. In the earlier centuries of the Christian Dispensation the fish was everywhere used as a symbol. In his remarkable book, &#x201c;Christian Iconography,&#x201d; Didron says:</p><p>&#x201c;The fish, in the opinion of antiquarians generally, is the symbol of Jesus Christ. The fish is sculptured upon a number of Christian monuments, and more particularly upon the ancient sarcophagi. It is also upon medals, bearing the name of our Savior and also upon engraved stones, cameos and intaglios. The fish is also to be remarked upon the amulets worn suspended from the necks by children, and upon ancient glasses and sculptured lamps.</p><p>&#x201c;Baptismal fonts are more particularly ornamented with the fish. The fish is constantly exhibited placed upon a dish in the middle of the table, at the Last Supper, among the loaves, knives and cups used at the banquet.&#x201d;</p><p>In the writings of Tertullian we find this statement: &#x201c;We are little fishes in Christ our great fish.&#x201d;</p><p>The last two thousand years, comprising the Piscean Age, has certainly been one of water and the many uses of that element have been emphasized, and sea and lake and river navigation has been brought to a high degree of efficiency.</p><p><i><b>3.</b> What is the Aquarian Age?</i> The human race is today standing upon the cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages. Aquarius is an air sign and the New Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air, electricity, magnetism, etc. Men navigate the air as fish do the sea, and send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of lightning.</p><p>The word Aquarius is derived from the Latin word aqua, meaning water. Aquarius is, however, the <i>water bearer</i>, and the symbol of the sign, which is the eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying in his right hand a pitcher of water. Jesus referred to the beginning of the Aquarian Age in these words:</p><p>&#x201c;And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an arc of heaven; the sign and signet of the Son of Man will stand forth in the eastern sky. The wise will then lift up their heads and know that the redemption of the earth is near.&#x201d; (Aquarian Gospel 157:29, 30.)</p><p>The Aquarian Age is pre-eminently a spiritual age, and the spiritual side of the great lessons that Jesus gave to the world may now be comprehended by multitudes of people for the many are now coming into an advanced stage of spiritual consciousness; so with much propriety this book is called &#x201c;The Aquarian (or Spiritual) Gospel of Jesus, the Christ.&#x201d;</p><p><i>An Important Event</i>. The transfer of dominion from one Age to another is an important event in the world of Cherubim and Seraphim. Among the manuscripts of Levi we have found a most remarkable paper describing the transfer of dominion from the Piscean Age to the Aquarian Age, but it is difficult to determine whether it is a recital of facts or a prophetic statement. We reproduce the paper in full.</p><p></p><p>THE CUSP OF THE AGES.</p><p>&#x201c;In Spirit I was caught away into the realms of Akasha; I stood alone within the circle of the sun.</p><p>&#x201c;And there I found the secret spring that opens up the door to Wisdom and an understanding heart.</p><p>&#x201c;I entered in and then I knew.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw the four and twenty Cherubim and Seraphim that guard the circle of the sun, the mighty ones who were proclaimed by masters long ago &#x2018;the four and twenty ancient ones.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the names of every Cherubim and Seraphim, and learned that every sign in all the Zodiac is ruled by two&#x2014;a Cherubim and Seraphim.</p><p>&#x201c;And then I stood upon the cusp where Ages meet. The Piscean Age had passed; the Aquarian Age had just begun.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw the guardian Spirits of the Piscean Age; Ramasa is the Cherubim; Vacabiel is Seraphim.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw the guardian Spirits of the Aquarian Age, and Archer is the Cherubim; Sakmaquil is the Seraphim.</p><p>&#x201c;These four great spirits of the Triune God stood close together on the cusp, and in the presence of the sacred Three&#x2014;the God of Might, the God of Wisdom, and the God of Love&#x2014;the scepter of Domain, of Might, of Wisdom and of Love was there transferred.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the charges of the Triune God; but these I may not now reveal.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard the history of the Piscean Age from Piscean Cherubim and Seraphim, and when I took my pen to write Ramasa said: </p><p>&#x201c;Not now, my son, not now; but you may write it down for men when men have learned the sacred laws of Brotherhood, of Peace on earth, good-will to every living thing.</p><p>&#x201c;And then I heard the Aquarian Cherubim and Seraphim proclaim the Gospel of the coming Age, the age of Wisdom, of the Son of Man.</p><p>&#x201c;And when the crown was lifted from the head of Ramasa and placed upon the head of Archer of the Aquarian Age; and when the royal scepter was transferred from Seraphim Vacabiel to Seraphim Sakmaquil there was deep silence in the courts of heaven.</p><p>&#x201c;And then the goddess Wisdom spoke, and with her hands outstretched she poured the benedictions of the Holy Breath upon the rulers of Aquarius.</p><p>&#x201c;I may not write the words she spoke, but I may tell the Gospel of the coming age that Archer told when he received the crown.</p><p>&#x201c;And I may breathe to men the song of praise that Seraphim Sakmaquil sung when she received the royal scepter of the newborn age.</p><p>&#x201c;This Gospel I will tell, and I will sing this song in every land, to all the people, tribes and t...</p></p><h2>Songwriting For Dummies 2e</h2><p><b>Proven techniques for songwriting success</b> <p>This friendly, hands-on guide tackles the new face of the recording industry, guiding you through the shift from traditional sales to downloads and mobile music, as well as how you can harness social media networks to get your music "out there."

Despite distressing statistics that show suicide rates rising, the subject, long a taboo, is infrequently talked about. In this sweeping intellectual and cultural history, poet and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht channels her grief for two friends lost to suicide into a search for history&#x2019;s most persuasive arguments against the irretrievable act, arguments she hopes to bring back into public consciousness.&nbsp;From the Stoics and the Bible to Dante, Shakespeare, Wittgenstein, and such twentieth-century writers as John Berryman, Hecht recasts the narrative of our &#x201c;secular age&#x201d; in new terms. She shows how religious prohibitions against self-killing were replaced by the Enlightenment&#x2019;s insistence on the rights of the individual, even when those rights had troubling applications. This transition, she movingly argues, resulted in a profound cultural and moral loss: the loss of shared, secular, logical arguments against suicide. By examining how people in other times have found powerful reasons to stay alive when suicide seems a tempting choice, she makes a persuasive intellectual and moral case against suicide.</p><p>How can we forestall&nbsp;the rising tide of suicides in the United States and worldwide?

Object-oriented (OO) technology has evolved as a means of managing the complexity inherent in many different kinds of systems. The object model has proven to be a very powerful and unifying concept.</p> <p><b>Changes to the Second Edition</b></p> <p>Since the publication of the second edition of Object-Oriented Analysis andDesign with Applications, we have seen major technological advances. This listincludes some highlights, among many others.</p> <ul> <li>High-bandwidth, wireless connectivity to the Internet is widely available.</li> <li>Nanotechnology has emerged and has started to provide valuable products.</li> <li>Our robots are cruising the surface of Mars.</li> <li>Computer-generated special effects have enabled the film industry to recreate any world imaginable with complete realism.</li> <li>Personal hovercraft are available.</li> <li>Mobile phones have become pervasive to the point of being disposable.</li> <li>We have mapped the human genome.</li> <li>Object-oriented technology has become well established in the mainstream of industrial-strength software development.</li> </ul> <p>We have encountered the use of the object-oriented paradigm throughout the world. However, we still encounter many people who have not yet adopted the object paradigm of development. For both of these groups, this revision of this book holds much value.</p> <p>For the person new to object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD), this book gives the following information:</p> <ul> <li>The conceptual underpinnings of and evolutionary perspective on object orientation</li> <li>Examples of how OOAD can be applied across the system development lifecycle</li> <li>An introduction to the standard notation used in system and software development, the Unified Modeling Language (UML 2.0)</li> <li>For the experienced OOAD practitioner, the content herein provides value from a different perspective.</li> <li>UML 2.0 is still new to even experienced practitioners. Here you will see the key changes in the notation.</li> <li>More focus on modeling is provided, per feedback received about the previous edition.</li> <li>You can gain a great appreciation for "why things are the way they are" in the object-oriented world, from the Concepts section of the book. Many people may never have been exposed to this information on the evolution of the OO concepts themselves. Even if you have been, you may not have grasped its significance when you were first learning the OO paradigm.</li> </ul> <p>There are four major differences between this edition and the previous publication.</p> <ol> <li>UML 2.0 has been officially approved. Chapter 5, Notation, will introduce UML 2.0. To enhance the reader's understanding of this notation, we explicitly distinguish between its fundamental and advanced elements.</li> <li>This edition introduces some new domains and contexts in the Applications chapters. For example, the application domains range broadly across various levels of abstraction from high-level systems architecture to the design details of a Web-based system.</li> <li>When the previous edition was published, C++ was relatively new, as was the very concept of OO programming. Readers tell us that this emphasis is no longer a primary concern. There is an abundance of OO programming and technique books and training available, not to mention additional programming languages designed for OO development. Therefore, most of the coding discussions have been removed.</li> <li>Finally, in response to requests received from readers, this edition focuses much more on the modeling aspects of OOAD. The Applications section will show you how to use the UML, with each chapter emphasizing one phase of the overall development lifecycle.</li> </ol> <p><b>Goals</b></p> <p>This book provides practical guidance on the analysis and design of object-oriented systems. Its specific goals are the following:</p> <ul> <li>To provide a sound understanding of the fundamental concepts and historical evolution of the object model</li> <li>To facilitate a mastery of the notation and process of object-oriented analysis and design</li> <li>To teach the realistic application of object-oriented analysis and design within a variety of problem domains The concepts presented all stand on a solid theoretical foundation, but this is primarily a pragmatic book that addresses the practical needs and concerns of software engineering practitioners, from the architect to the software developer.</li> </ul> <p><b>Audience</b></p> <p>This book is written for the computer professional as well as for the student.</p> <ul> <li>For the practicing systems and software developer, we show you how to effectively use object-oriented technology to solve real problems.</li> <li>In your role as an analyst or architect, we offer you a path from requirements to implementation, using object-oriented analysis and design. We develop your ability to distinguish "good" object-oriented architectures from "bad" ones and to trade off alternate designs when the perversity of the real world intrudes. Perhaps most important, we offer you fresh approaches to reasoning about complex systems.</li> <li>For the program manager, we provide insight on topics such as allocation of resources of a team of developers, software quality, metrics, and management of the risks associated with complex software systems.</li> <li>For the student, we provide the instruction necessary for you to begin acquiring several important skills in the science and art of developing complex systems.</li> </ul> <p>This book is also suitable for use in undergraduate and graduate courses as well as in professional seminars and individual study. Because it deals primarily with a method of software development, it is most appropriate for courses in software engineering and as a supplement to courses involving specific object-oriented programming languages.</p> <p><b>Structure</b></p> <p>The book is divided into three major sections--Concepts, Method, and Applications--with considerable supplemental material woven throughout.</p> <p><b>Concepts</b></p> <p>Section I examines the inherent complexity of software and the ways in which complexity manifests itself. We present the object model as a means of helping us manage this complexity. In detail, we examine the fundamental elements of the object model such as: abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, and hierarchy. We address basic questions such as "What is a class?" and "What is an object?" </p> <p>Because the identification of meaningful classes and objects is the key task in object-oriented development, we spend considerable time studying the nature of classification. In particular, we examine approaches to classification in other disciplines, such as biology, linguistics, and psychology, and then apply these lessons to the problem of discovering classes and objects in software systems.</p> <p><b>Method</b></p> <p>Section II presents a method for the development of complex systems based on the object model. We first present a graphic notation (i.e., the UML) for object-oriented analysis and design, followed by a generic process framework. We also examine the pragmatics of object-oriented development--in particular, its place in the software development lifecycle and its implications for project management.</p> <p><b>Applications</b></p> <p>Section III offers a collection of five nontrivial examples encompassing a diverse selection of problem domains: system architecture, control systems, cryptanalysis, data acquisition, and Web development. We have chosen these particular problem domains because they are representative of the kinds of complex problems faced by the practicing software engineer. It is easy to show how certain principles apply to simple problems, but because our focus is on building useful systems for the real world, we are more interested in showing how the object model scales up to complex applications. The development of software systems is rarely amenable to cookbook approaches; therefore, we emphasize the incremental development of applications, guided by a number of sound principles and well-formed models.</p> <p><b>Supplemental Material</b></p> <p>A considerable amount of supplemental material is woven throughout the book. Most chapters have sidebars that provide information on related topics. We include an appendix on object-oriented programming languages that summarizes the features of a few common languages. We also provide a glossary of common terms and an extensive classified bibliography that lists references to source material on the object model.</p> <p><b>A Note about Tools</b></p> <p>Readers always ask about the tools used to create the diagrams in the book. Primarily, we have used two fine tools for the diagrams: IBM Rational Software Architect and Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect. Why not use just one? The reality of the marketplace is that no tool does everything. The longer you do OOAD, you will eventually find some atypical "corner case" that no tool supports. (In that case, you may have to resort to basic drawing tools to show what you want.) But don't let those rare instances stop you from using robust OOAD tools such as those we mentioned.</p> <p><b>Using This Book</b></p> <p>This book may be read from cover to cover or it may be used in less structured ways. If you are seeking a deep understanding of the underlying concepts of the object model or the motivation for the principles of object-oriented development, you should start with Chapter 1 and continue forward in order. If you are primarily interested in learning the details of the notation and process of object-oriented analysis and design, start with Chapters 5 and 6; Chapter 7 is especially useful to managers of projects using this method.

Much more than a simple account of the long struggle between the two superpowers, this vibrant text opens with chapters exploring the development of regional conflicts--ethnic, religious, cultural, economic, and military--that dominated international relations until the breakup of the Soviet Union. The final chapters examine the war on terror and the salience of interstate and transnational conflicts in the era of globalization. In engaging, compelling language, author William R. Keylor provides a genuinely international history of this turbulent period.<br><br>Designed to serve the needs of both political scientists and historians, the new edition has been reorganized along regional lines while still maintaining the chronological approach of the previous edition.

Crafted with the same care and insight as her award-winning novels, <i>Absence of Mind</i> challenges postmodern atheists who crusade against religion under the banner of science. In Robinson&#x2019;s view, scientific reasoning does not denote a sense of logical infallibility, as thinkers like Richard Dawkins might suggest. Instead, in its purest form, science represents a search for answers. It engages the problem of knowledge, an aspect of the mystery of consciousness, rather than providing a simple and final model of reality.</p><p>By defending the importance of individual reflection, Robinson celebrates the power and variety of human consciousness in the tradition of William James. She explores the nature of subjectivity and considers the culture in which Sigmund Freud was situated and its influence on his model of self and civilization.&nbsp;Through keen interpretations of language, emotion, science, and poetry,<i> Absence of Mind</i> restores human consciousness to its central place in the religion-science debate.</p></p><p><b>Marilynne Robinson</b> is the author of <i>Gilead</i>, winner of the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for fiction; <i>Home</i>, winner of the 2009 Orange Prize for Fiction; and <i>Housekeeping</i>, winner of the 1982 Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for first fiction. She is also the author of two previous books of nonfiction, <i>Mother Country</i> and <i>The Death of Adam</i>. She teaches at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop and lives in Iowa City."There is much to admire, and even to agree with, in Robinson's humanist passion. Her defense of the insights to be gained from religion and literature is as convincing as her attacks on the facile generalizations of parascience."&#x2014;Adam Kirsch, <i>Boston Globe</i><br>"[Robinson] makes the case with exceptional elegance and authority&#x2014;the authority not only of one of the unmistakably great novelists of the age but of a clear and logical mind that is wholly intolerant of intellectual clich�. . . . This book has a greater density (and sophistication) of argument than many three times its length; but it is one of the most significant contributions yet to the current quarrels about faith, science and rationality."&#x2014;Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br>"These impassioned pages require and reward very close attention."&#x2014;Michael Dirda,<i> Washington Post</i><br>"Those who savor Robinson's clear prose will be gratified; her mind, in thought, is elegant."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><p>"Robinson's arguments [are] so much more interesting, capacious, and informed than most. . . . Robinson makes a strong, unapologetic case, not for mystery but for self-respect."&#x2014;Susan Salter Reynolds, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><br>"At a moment in cultural history dominated by the shallow, the superficial, the quick fix, Marilynne Robinson is a miraculous anomaly: a writer who thoughtfully, carefully, and tenaciously explores some of the deepest questions confronting the human species."&#x2015;Merle Rubin, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> on <i>Gilead</i><br><p>"Pulitzer Prize-winner Robinson may be the only living novelist who has made a genuine contribution to philosophical reflection. . . . One of the most thought-stirring inquiries into fundamental questions that has appeared in many years."&#x2014;John Gray, <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i></p><br><p>"[Robinson] is one of the best thinkers in American letters. Her new (nonfiction) work is a slashing attack on scientific fundamentalism, not on behalf of religion but of human consciousness and our traditional concept of mind."&#x2014;<i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i></p><p><i></i></p><br><p>"Marilynne Robinson asks hard questions. She challenges readers with a severe, sophisticated and spellbinding style and a determination to change the conversation about contemporary American culture. . . . <i>Absence of Mind</i> is important not so much as a brief for religion but as a tenacious and often trenchant critique of modern Western thought."&#x2014;Glenn Altschuler,<i> Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i></p><br><p>"What Robinson has over both the parascientific writers whose work she rejects and the religion writers with whom she finds common ground is a long career (though few books) as a fiction writer, where she has demonstrated&#x2014;and in her way, provided evidence of&#x2014;the very contemplative, subjective lives of the faithful she defends in her new book."&#x2014;Scott Korb, <i>The Revealer</i></p><br>"[Robinson reveals] how deep a debt both science and religion owe to art. . . . It is a rare treat to have a novelist express herself so forcefully, and so eloquently, in another medium."&#x2014;Ingrid Rowland,<i> American Scholar</i><br>"[Not] an anti-scientific jeremiad. Quite the contrary, for Robinson admires all that genuine science continues to offer us. . . . Her wonderful defense of an expansive self in a diminishing age deserves a wide readership."&#x2014;Thomas DePietro,<i> Barnes &amp; Noble Review</i><br>"The scope of Robinson's erudition is stunning, and she shares it with generosity and no dissembling."&#x2014;Linda McCullough Moore, <i>Books &amp; Culture</i><br>"Marked by a luminous intelligence and a rather attractive intellectual severity. . . .

Trouble is, she's the daughter of a once-famous author with a severe case of writer's block. Her family--beautiful sister Rose, brooding father James, ethereal stepmother Topaz--is barely scraping by in a crumbling English castle they leased when times were good. Now there's very little furniture, hardly any food, and just a few pages of notebook paper left to write on. Bravely making the best of things, Cassandra gets hold of a journal and begins her literary apprenticeship by refusing to face the facts. She writes, "I have just remarked to Rose that our situation is really rather romantic, two girls in this strange and lonely house. She replied that she saw nothing romantic about being shut up in a crumbling ruin surrounded by a sea of mud."<p> Rose longs for suitors and new tea dresses while Cassandra scorns romance: "I know all about the facts of life. And I don't think much of them." But romantic isolation comes to an end both for the family and for Cassandra's heart when the wealthy, adventurous Cotton family takes over the nearby estate. Cassandra is a witty, pensive, observant heroine, just the right voice for chronicling the perilous cusp of adulthood. Some people have compared <i>I Capture the Castle</i> to the novels of Jane Austen, and it's just as well-plotted and witty. But the Mortmains are more bohemian--as much like the Addams Family as like any of Austen's characters. Dodie Smith, author of <i>101 Dalmations</i>, wrote this novel in 1948. And though the story is set in the 1930s, it still feels fresh, and well deserves its reputation as a modern classic. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>"<i>I Capture the Castle</i> is finally back in print. It should be welcomed with a bouquet of roses and a brass band. Ever since I was handed a tattered copy years ago with the recommendation 'You'll love it,' it has been one of my favorite novels. Cassandra Mortmain is one hell of a narrator, offering sharp wit, piercing insight and touching lyricism. She is a heroine we readers wish we could be, a young woman it is impossible not to adore." --Susan Isaacs<p> "Dreamy and funny...an odd, shimmering timelessness clings to its pages. A thousand and one cheers for its reissue. A+" --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p> "It is an occasion worth celebrating when a sparkling novel, a work of wit, irony and feeling is brought back into print after an absence of many years. So uncork the champagne for <i>I Capture the Castle</i>." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p> "It's as fresh as if it were written this morning and as classic as Jane Austen. I'm very happy to have met it." --Donald Westlake</p><p> "A delicious, compulsively readable novel about young love and its vicissitudes. What fun!" --Erica Jong</p><p> "Much more fun than the reader has any right to expect." --<i>The Weekly Standard</i></p></p><h2>Rush for Riches: Gold Fever and the Making of California</h2><p>In this vivid account of the birth of modern California, J.S. Holliday frames the gold rush years within the larger story of the state's transformation from the quietude of a Mexican hinterland in the 1840s to the forefront of entrepreneurial capitalism by the 1890s. No other state, no nation experienced such an adolescence of freedom and success. By 1883 California was hailed as "America, only more so."<br><br>Holliday's boldly interpretive narrative has the authority and immediacy of an eyewitness account. This eminent historian recreates the masculine world of mining camps and rough cities, where both business and pleasure were conducted far from hometown eyes and conventional inhibitions. He follows gold mining's swift evolution from treasure hunt to vast industry; traces the prodigal plunder of California's virgin rivers and abundant forests; and describes improvised feats of engineering, breathtaking in their scope and execution.<br><br>Holliday also conjures the ambitious, often ruthless Californians whose rush for riches rapidly changed the state: the Silver Kings of the Comstock Lode, the timber barons of the Sierra forests, the Big Four who built the first transcontinental railroad, and the lesser profit-seekers who owned steamboats, pack mules, gambling dens and bordellos&#x2015;and, most important for California's future, the farmers who prospered by feeding the rapidly growing population. This wildly laissez-faire economy created California's image as a risk-taking society, unconstrained by fear of failure.<br><br>The central theme of <i>Rush for Riches</i> is how, after decades of careless freedom, the miners were finally reined in by the farmers, and how their once mutually dependent relationship soured into hostility. This potential violence led to a dramatic courtroom decision in 1884 that shut down the mighty hydraulic mining operations&#x2015;the end of California's free-for-all youthful exuberance.<br><br>Unique in its format, this beautiful book offers not only a compelling narrative but also almost two hundred fifty illustrations, one hundred in full color, that richly illuminate the themes and details of the text: daguerreotypes, photographs, paintings, lithographs, sketches, and specially drawn maps.<br><br><i>Los Angeles Times Best Nonfiction Book of 2000</i></p><p>"J.S.

For many of us, anatomy can seem intimidating and unrewarding, but the right teacher can clear such feelings away in a heartbeat. Our fascination with our bodies is a powerful force, and once we start looking, we find that beauty is much more than skin-deep.<p> It so happens that the right teacher can take the form of a book. <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> is one of those few titles that practically everybody has heard of, and with good reason--it is a scientific and artistic triumph. Not just a dry index of parts and names, <i>Gray's</i> lets the natural beauty and grace of the body's interconnected systems and structures shine forth from the page. Using sumptuous illustrations and clear, matter-of-fact descriptions, Dr. Gray unleashed a classic on the world more than 100 years ago. Its clarity and usefulness keep it in print today. Whether you want to understand yourself or others, knowledge of our physical parts and how they fit together is essential. <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> provides that information in a simple, timeless format that cleanly dissects a body of knowledge grown over centuries. This book will not only fill the needs of people in the medical profession, but will please artists and naturalists as well. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>This is a landmark edition of one of the greatest texts of our time. <i>Gray's Anatomy </i>has been an international bestseller for 100 years; its appeal is not only to physicians and students, but to artists and the medically curious. As the new Introduction by Dr. Crocco states: "Every living physician today has been exposed to <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> and nearly everyone has used it. It was<i> Gray's Anatomy </i>that occupied most of the embryonic physician's waking hours, whether at home or at the side of his cadaver.<br>"There have been many imitations, but few real competitors. There have been dissection manuals and pictorial atlases brilliantly illustrated with exquisite photographs. There have been synopses of anatomy and there have been monographs on various regions of the body. However, there is only one <i>Gray's Anatomy.<br>"</i>This stellar book represents the acme of anatomical description over the last century and will probably still be the premier text in anatomy over the next one hundred years. This commemorative edition is a very fitting tribute to Dr. Henry Gray, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, whose colossal work will be remembered by medical historians past and future and by twentieth-century physicians and surgeons as the anatomy text of our age."</p><h2>Meatless Days</h2><p>In this finely wrought memoir of life in postcolonial Pakistan, Suleri intertwines the violent history of Pakistan's independence with her own most intimate memories&#x2014;of her Welsh mother; of her Pakistani father, prominent political journalist Z.A.

Instead, they found disease, hunger, and hostile natives. Ill prepared for such hardship, the men responded with incompetence and infighting; only the leadership of Captain John Smith averted doom for the first permanent English settlement in the New World.The Jamestown colony is one of the great survival stories of American history, and this book brings it fully to life for the first time. Drawing on extensive original documents, David A. Price paints intimate portraits of the major figures from the formidable monarch Chief Powhatan, to the resourceful but unpopular leader John Smith, to the spirited Pocahontas, who twice saved Smith&#x2019;s life. He also gives a rare balanced view of relations between the settlers and the natives and debunks popular myths about the colony. This is a superb work of history, reminding us of the horrors and heroism that marked the dawning of our nation.</p><p>"A fine book...one that personifies the virtues I esteem...clarity, intelligence, grace,<br>novelty, and brevity." <br> --David L. Beck, San Jose <i>Mecury News<br></i><br>Solid and engaging...

Ellis, author of <i>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation<br><br></i>"In a rousing tale of the early years of Jamestown, David A.

Beck, San Jose <i>Mecury News<br></i>A gripping narrative of one of the great survival stories of American history: the opening of the first permanent English settlement in the New World. Drawing on period letters and chronicles, and on the papers of the Virginia Company-which financed the settlement of Jamestown-David Price tells a tale of cowardice and courage, stupidity and brilliance, tragedy and costly triumph. He takes us into the day-to-day existence of the English men and women whose charge was to find gold and a route to the Orient, and who found, instead, hardship and wretched misery. Death, in fact, became the settlers' most faithful companion, and their infighting was ceaseless. <br>Price offers a rare balanced view of the relationship between the settlers and the natives. He unravels the crucial role of Pocahontas, a young woman whose reality has been obscured by centuries of legend and misinformation (and, more recently, animation). He paints indelible portraits of Chief Powhatan, the aged monarch who came close to ending the colony's existence, and Captain John Smith, the former mercenary and slave, whose disdain for class distinctions infuriated many around him-even as his resourcefulness made him essential to the colony's success. <br>"Love and Hate in Jamestown is a superb work of popular history, reminding us of the horrors and heroism that marked the dawning of our nation.</p><h2>The Manual of Photography, Tenth Edition</h2><p><p>The tenth edition of The Manual of Photography is an indispensable textbook for anyone who is serious about photography.

First, the <em>Compendium</em> is intended to serve as a guidebook that provides a comprehensive overview of the essential aspects of neuropsychological assessment practice.<br>Second, it is intended as a comprehensive sourcebook of critical reviews of major neuropsychological assessment tools for the use by practicing clinicians and researchers. Written in a comprehensive, easy to read reference format, and based on exhaustive review of research literature in neuropsychology, neurology, psychology, and related disciplines, the book covers topics such as basic aspects of neuropsychological assessment as well as the theoretical background, norms, and the utility, reliability, and validity of neuropsychological tests.<br>For this third edition, all chapters have been extensively revised and updated. The text has been considerably expanded to provide a comprehensive yet practical overview of the state of the field. Two new chapters have been added: "Psychometrics in Neuropsychological Assessment" and "Norms in Psychological Assessment." The first two chapters present basic psychometric concepts and principles. Chapters three and four consider practical aspects of the history taking interview and the assessment process itself. Chapter five provides guidelines on report writing and chapters six through sixteen consist of detailed, critical reviews of neuropsychological tests, and address the topics of intelligence, achievement, executive function, attention, memory, language, visual perception, somatosensory olfactory function, mood/personality, and response bias. A unique feature is the inclusion of tables that summarize salient features of tests within each domain so that readers can easily compare measures. Additional tables within each test review summarize important features of each test, highlight aspects of each normative dataset, and provide an overview of psychometric properties. Of interest to neuropsychologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and educational and clinical psychologists working with adults as well as pediatric populations, this volume will aid practitioners in selecting appropriate testing measures for their patients, and will provide them with the knowledge needed to make empirically supported interpretations of test results.<br></p><p>Esther Strauss is at University of British Columbia.

The third edition continues this excellence...The third edition is significantly updated and expanded and is worth the price, even for owners of previous editions."--<em>Doody's</em><p></p><br>"As stated in the preface, the goal for this edition was to create a user-friendly reference work that covered all the relevant details of the most frequently used neuropsychological tests, and to provide a general overview of issues 'germane to neuropsychological assessment.' In short: to help you 'know your tools' and to function as a guidebook to the practice of neuropsychology. These goals are surely met- beyond all expections...Having a copy of the third edition of the <em>Compendium</em> at hand would help any of us 'know our tools' substantially better. <em>A Compendium of Neuropsychological</em> <em>Tests, Third Edition</em> is a mature work of outstanding scholarship, and it should find a place on every neuropsychologist's desk."--<em>JINS</em><p></p><br>"<em>A Compendium of Neuropsychological Tests</em> is very well written and superbly organized and would be a valuable addition to the personal library of any clinical neuropsychologist. The book provides an excellent update of current research on a wide sample of neuropsychological tests."--<em>PsycCRITIQUES</em><p></p><br>"The third edition of <em>A Compendium</em> on Neuropsychological Tests is a splendid and magnificent achievement in the field of neuropsychology. We all owe a great deal of debt to Drs. Strauss, Sherman, and Spreen for creating such a masterpiece that is literally a must have for all neuropsychologists."--<em>Applied Neuropsychology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Essentials of MIS, Student Value Edition</h2><p><p> <b> <b> <b>NOTE:&nbsp;</b> </b> </b>This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Collected for the first time in <i><b>Autograf: New York City&#x2019;s Graffiti Writers</b></i>, Sutherland presents a never-before-seen chronicle of the people and places that populate New York&#x2019;s famed graf scene. Featuring old-school legends FUTURA, STAY HIGH 149, LADY PINK and DOZE, as well as new-school writers COPE 2, CLAW, KR, CYCLE, KAWS, SACER, EARSNOT, SERF, RATE, CINIK, UFO, and DSENSE, among many others, each one of the fifty-three portraits is authentically tagged by the individual writers using the same paint markers that brought them fame. Complemented by one hundred sixty landscape photographs and featuring handwritten text by legendary recluse REVS, <i>Autograf</i> is the only book to showcase New York City&#x2019;s graffiti scene as it was created and defined by some of the most prolific artists of our time.</p><p>A controversial art form and provocative cultural phenomenon, graffiti has inestimably influenced our entire environment&#x2014;from music and fashion to advertising, architecture, and graphic arts. Yet it is an illegal activity, which makes its practitioners wanted criminals. Motivated by a desire for self-expression and recognition, the act of marking one&#x2019;s territory is done at the risk of severe consequences including fines and jail time. Graffiti writers are outlaws, unknown artists whose faces are known only to their peers. Treated as criminals by the law and dismissed as artists by the establishment, writers are perceived as either alluring anti-heroes or loathsome vandals, and usually remain anonymous to their audience. But not to photographer <b>Peter Sutherland</b>.Almost every artist's face in this 71/2"�101/4" collection of 96 hot-looking four-color portraits (with a few more in b&amp;w) is obscured in some way, reminding us that while some may see these writers as artists, many others, including the police, perceive them as criminals. It's an apt irony for an art form (one still hotly debated as such) that is all about identity and its "tags," placed in inaccessible locations and under trying circumstances. So when an artist among these leathered and t-shirted urban verbal guerillas here decides to bare his or her face (an act of bravery, or bravado?), it's a shock; each artist is more fully represented by his or her unique "autograf" (or tag) perfectly scrawled in thick glossy marker over each shot. REVS, whose huge white block letters are familiar to most New Yorkers, provides a (nicely reproduced) handwritten text on yellow legal paper, complete with misspellings, underlinings and exclamation points: "We need to be paintin 5, 10, 20 story buildings top to bottom with somethin to say... where none of these people in power... can discount your existence!" This terrific books shows its subjects in full effect (if in full stealth mode) with their canvas&#x2014;New York's five boroughs&#x2014;sprawled out beautifully and variously behind them, and their names. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Woodrow Wilson called his approach a "fresh and original method which has made the British system much ore intelligible to ordinary men than it was before."</p><p>For anyone who wants to understand the workings of British politics, this book, written in 1867, is still the best introduction available. It is a study of the classical period of Cabinet government before the extension of the suffrage, the creation of the party machines, and the emergence of an independent Civil Service administering a vast welfare state.</p><p>A thoughtful and provocative introduction by R. H. S. Crossman, M.P., gives biographical material on Bagehot, compares his political philosophy with those of his contemporaries, and contrasts Britain's parliamentary government today with that of the last century.</p></p><p>Editor of The Economist from 1861 until his death, Walter Bagehot (1826-77) wrote across an array of subjects, from banking to literature. In this classic 1867 publication, he sought to describe the &#39;living reality&#39; of how Britain was governed, making a notable distinction between &#39;dignified&#39; and &#39;efficient&#39; constitutional components.Chronicling the past is much easier than chronicling the present, which was exactly Walter Bagehot's project when writing The English Constitution, first published in 1873. His ambitious undertaking was to describe the British government as it actually worked during 1865 and 1866.

Incorporating introductions, readings, and cases that span the breadth of the discipline, this exceptional volume captures the spirit of bioethics as a rich, exciting, and continuously evolving field. Addressing all of the essential topics--including abortion, reproductive ethics, end-of-life care, research ethics, and the allocation of resources--it also moves beyond the "classic" approach of other books by extending into timely and provocative issues like terrorism, cosmetic surgery, immigration, genetic manipulations, links between first- and third-world health, and--unique to this book--environmental sustainability and climate change. In addition, <em>Contemporary Bioethics</em> is the only book of its kind that includes both philosophical and religious perspectives.<br><br>The text opens with a substantial introduction that presents key ethical principles, theories, and methods and shows students how to use these tools to frame and address ethical dilemmas in medicine. Covering the brief yet captivating history of the field, the introduction also considers the role of religion in the development of bioethics and examines differences between secular and religious modes of argumentation. Each of the seven topical chapters contains an in-depth introduction, a selection of concise readings representing a diverse range of moral perspectives (including feminist, religious, secular, and third-world), discussion questions, and a collection of full-length and provocative case studies that enable students to further explore the issues.<br><br>Ideal for introductory courses in bioethics and biomedical ethics, <em>Contemporary Bioethics</em> is supplemented by a Instructor's Manual on CD and a Companion Website containing resources for both students and professors, including chapter summaries, additional cases with discussion questions, ideas for further reading, vocabulary flashcards, self-quizzes, and more.<br></p><p>Pierce is Assistant Professor, Department of Preventive and Societal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

A fifteen-year-old boy listens to WNEW on the radio in his bedroom in Brooklyn. A monotone voice (it's the singer's) announces into dead air in between songs "The Talking Heads have a new album, it's called Fear of Music" - and everything spins outward from that one moment.</p><p>Jonathan Lethem treats<i> Fear of Music</i> (the third album by the Talking Heads, and the first produced by Brian Eno) as a masterpiece - edgy, paranoid, funky, addictive, rhythmic, repetitive, spooky and fun. He scratches obsessively at the album's songs, guitars, rhythms, lyrics, packaging, downtown origins, and legacy, showing how Fear of Music hints at the directions (positive and negative) the band would take in the future. Lethem transports us again to the New York City of another time - tackling one of his great adolescent obsessions and illuminating the ways in which we fall in and out of love with works of art.</p></p><p>Jonathan Lethem is one of the most acclaimed American novelists of his generation. His books include <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i>, <i>The Fortress of Solitude</i>, and <i>Chronic City</i>. His essays about James Brown and Bob Dylan have appeared in <i>Rolling Stone</i>. He is Roy Edward Disney Professor in Creative Writing at Pomona College, US.&#x201c;By far the biggest name in the 33 1/3 roster of writers, Jonathan Lethem is no music critic, but an award-winning fiction writer ... His take on Talking Heads' 1979 album forgoes fiction for first-person criticism, in which Lethem's teenage self acts as a sympathetic protagonist. Even as he plumbs each song on <i>Fear of Music</i> for meaning and significance, he uses the album as a point against which he can measure his own growth as a listener, becoming older and wiser and hungrier for connection with each year and with each listen.&#x201d; &#x2015;Stephen M.

From using a bitcoin wallet to buy a cup of coffee, to running a bitcoin marketplace with hundreds of thousands of transactions, or collaboratively building new financial innovations that will transform our understanding of currency and credit, this book will help you engineer money. You're about to unlock the API to a new economy. This book is your key.<br><br>This book will help you learn everything you need to know about decentralized digital money, which is one of the most exciting technical revolutions in decades. Just as the Internet has transformed dozens of industries - from media and entertainment to retailing, travel and many more - decentralized digital money, in the form of crypto-currencies, has the ability to transform the foundations of money, credit and financial services. It also has the power to transform other social activities and institutions that we don't usually associate directly with money, such as corporations, governance, voting and the law. <br><br>As the first successful digital currency, bitcoin is the natural starting point for anyone interested in decentralized digital money, its implications and applications. Mastering Bitcoin describes the technical foundations of bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies, from cryptography basics, such as keys and addresses, to the data structures, network protocols and the consensus mechanism ("mining") that underpin bitcoin. Each technical topic is explained with user stories, elegant analogies and examples, and code snippets illustrating the key concepts. The first two chapters offer a broad and accessible introduction to bitcoin that is intended for all audiences, from new non-technical users to investors and business executives seeking to better understand bitcoin. The remainder of the book dives into the technical details of bitcoin's operation and is aimed at professional developers, engineers, software and systems architects, systems administrators and technically-minded people interested in the inner workings of bitcoin and comparable crypto-currencies. Mastering Bitcoin is intended to be used as a reference book for technical professionals, as a self-study guide for bitcoin entrepreneurs, and as a textbook for university courses on bitcoin and digital currencies. <br><br>Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and yet it has already spawned a multi-billion dollar, global economy that is growing exponentially. Both new and established companies are adding bitcoin as a payment method, and investors are funding a flurry of new bitcoin and related startups. Mastering Bitcoin can help you become part of this vibrant new economy. The time to get started is now.</p><p>Andreas M.

Tebbel traces the evolution of the industry through a fascinating series of developments: the astonishing rise of paperbacks before the Civil War, book selling through subscription, the great fiction boom of the 1890s, bouts with censorship, the tremendous growth of specialized publishing, and the escalating role of advertising, promotion, and publicity. The closing pages deal with the explosion in mass market publishing of the postwar era and the entry of conglomerates, and examine the state of publishing today.

No longer would young men find their futures determined by the selective service system; nor would the U.S. military have a guaranteed source of recruits.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br><i>America&#x2019;s Army</i> is the story of the all-volunteer force, from the draft protests and policy proposals of the 1960s through the Iraq War. It is also a history of America in the post-Vietnam era. In the Army, America directly confronted the legacies of civil rights and black power, the women&#x2019;s movement, and gay rights. The volunteer force raised questions about the meaning of citizenship and the rights and obligations it carries; about whether liberty or equality is the more central American value; what role the military should play in American society not only in time of war, but in time of peace. And as the Army tried to create a volunteer force that could respond effectively to complex international situations, it had to compete with other &#x201c;employers&#x201d; in a national labor market and sell military service alongside soap and soft drinks. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Based on exhaustive archival research, as well as interviews with Army officers and recruiters, advertising executives, and policy makers, <i>America&#x2019;s Army</i> confronts the political, moral, and social issues a volunteer force raises for a democratic society as well as for the defense of our nation.<br></p></p><p>Beth Bailey is Professor of History at Temple University.Compact, comprehensive, and empathetic, <i>America's Army</i> provides a much-needed account of the all-volunteer army, from its difficult birth after Vietnam down to its challenging present. An important story exceedingly well told. (Andrew J. Bacevich, author of The New American Militarism: How Americans Are Seduced by War)<br><br>Every American should read Beth Bailey's excellent book on America's Army.

(Ronald Spector, Professor of History and International Affairs, The George Washington University)<br><br>Beth Bailey has written an accessible and informative history of the [All-Volunteer Force]. It's a valuable reference work for anyone interested in the armed forces. The book has added value today, given the strain under which the military has found itself in fighting lengthy insurgencies in both Afghanistan and Iraq. (Doug Bandow <i>Washington Times</i> 2009-12-23)<br><br>This excellent analytical history is particularly timely. It thoroughly surveys the volunteer force's emergence from the so-called "hollow army" over the past decades, and it analyzes such specific issues as the effect on gender roles of the greater number of women in service, the effect on career patterns due to the absence of a draft, and how to instill the warrior ethos, assuming that that is still necessary in an age of high-tech combat. The ultimate questions raised are whether the all-volunteer force doesn't sacrifice civic responsibility to individual liberty and what the answer to that question implies. Intensely serious, painstakingly thorough, and deserving addition to collections concerned with military and current affairs. (Roland Green <i>Booklist</i> 2009-10-07)</p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets: With Analytic Commentary</h2><p>This new edition focuses on the Sonnets as poetry - sometimes strikingly individual poems, but often subtly interlinked in thematic, imagistic and other groupings. Gwynne Evans and Anthony Hecht also address the many questions that cast a veil of mystery over the genesis of the Sonnets: to what extent are they autobiographical? What is the nature of the &#39;love&#39;, strongly expressed, between the &#39;poet&#39;, the &#39;youth&#39; and the &#39;Dark Lady&#39;? Can they, apart from the poet, be identified? Who is the &#39;rival poet&#39;? When were the Sonnets written and in what order? What were the circumstances surrounding their publication?</p><p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564-1616) wrote 37 plays. <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> are widely considered his finest and most popular. They are, perhaps, the most frequently produced works on the planet.Since we will never hear tapes of Keats or Shakespeare reading, and several recordings by actors exist (e.g., John Keats: Selected Poems, Blackstone Audio, 1993; Sonnets by William Shakespeare, Recorded Bks., 1990), we must judge these tapes by the actors' performances. In John Keats: Poems, Douglas Dodge modulates his voice beautifully to capture the slightly varied emotions of many poems. This well-edited recording contains Keats's most famous works: "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," "The Eve of St. Agnes," "Ode to a Nightingale," "On a Grecian Urn," along with many lesser-known short poems such as "To Mrs. Reynolds' Cat" that exhibit the poet's more fanciful side. Reading all of Shakespeare's sonnets written between 1593 and 1601, actor Simon Callow conveys the dramatic potential not often recognizable in other recordings. With the exception of a few sonnets addressing the muse, anyone unfamiliar with Shakespeare's works could easily believe these were selected monologs from various plays. Pausing briefly between poems, Callow's tone shifts enough to create new characterizations for every sonnet. Both tapes are recommended for smaller collections and essential for larger ones.<br><i>Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, "Soho Weekly News," New York</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spanish English Bilingual Visual Dictionary (DK Visual Dictionaries)</h2><p>Newly revised and updated, the <i>Spanish-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> is a quick and intuitive way to learn and recall everyday words in Spanish. <p>The <i>Spanish-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> introduces a range of useful current vocabulary in thematic order, using full-color photographs and artworks to display and label all the elements of everyday life &#x2014; from the home and office to sport, music, nature, and the countries of the world &#x2014; with panel features on key nouns, verbs, and useful phrases.</p> <p>The <i>Spanish-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> features:</p> <ul> <li>A quick and intuitive way to learn and remember thousands of words.</li> <li>A complete range of illustrated objects and scenes from everyday life.</li> <li>Fast and effective learning for any situation, from home and office to shopping and dining out.</li> <li>Detailed index for instant reference.</li> <li>Handy size ideal for travel.</li> </ul> <p>The illustrations in the <i>Spanish-English Bilingual Visual Dictionary</i> provide a quick and intuitive route to learning a language, defining the words visually so it is easier to remember them and creating a colorful and stimulating learning resource for the foreign-language and EFL/ESL student.</p></p><p>DK was founded in London in 1974 and is now the world's leading illustrated reference publisher and part of Penguin Random House, formed on July 1, 2013.

Crumb: The Complete Record Cover Collection</h2><p><p><strong>A landmark work that pays splendid homage to a forgotten era of seminal American music.</strong></p> Robert Crumb first began drawing record covers in 1968 when Janis Joplin, a fellow Haight Ashbury denizen, asked him to provide a cover for her album <em>Cheap Thrills</em>. It was an invitation the budding artist couldn't resist, especially since he had been fascinated with record covers-particularly for the legendary jazz, country, and old-time blues music of the 1920s and 1930s-since he was a teen. This early collaboration proved so successful that Crumb went on to draw hundreds of record covers for both new artists and largely forgotten masters. So remarkable were Crumb's artistic interpretations of these old 78 rpm singles that the art itself proved influential in their rediscovery in the 1960s and 1970s. Including such classics as <em>Truckin' My Blues Away, Harmonica Blues</em>, and <em>Please Warm My Weiner</em>, Crumb's opus also features more recent covers done for CDs. <em>R. Crumb: The Complete Record Cover Collection</em> is a must-have for any lover of graphics and old-time music. 450 four-color illustrations</p><p>In this collection of interviews that spans from the late 1960s to the beginning of the twenty-first century, the comic artist proves to be iconoclastic, opinionated, and impervious to the commercial moods of the publicBorn in Philadelphia, R.

The author describes in vivid and concrete terms what it meant in the twelfth century to be a famous scientist (the master of Latin, logic and philosophy), then a dedicated monk and pioneer of the discipline of theology - and yet one who was at various times a wandering scholar, courtier and jester. The author's many new findings include the discovery that it was Heloise who inspired many of Abelard's most profound ideas. <i>She</i> educated <i>him:</i> up to now historians have assumed it to be the other way round.</p> <p>This, the first biography of Abelard for over 30 years, combines the most recent international research with a re-reading of the sources line by line.</p></p><h2>The Everything Guide to Macronutrients: The Flexible Eating Plan for Losing Fat and Getting Lean</h2><p><b>Learn about the basics of macronutrients&#x2014;carbohydrates, fats, and protein&#x2014;how to count them, and how to successfully lose weight in this new guide!</b><br><br>Are you trying to diet but still get tempted by a slice of pizza or a juicy burger, knowing you won&#x2019;t be able to say no?

Lavishly illustrated, this book tells an intriguing story in which the heritage of antiquity intertwines with the living presence of Christianity. Written by one of the great art historians of our time, it offers a profile of the Eternal City unlike any drawn in the past or likely to be drawn in the future.</p><br><p> "Krautheimer was never (or only rarely) interested in studying heavily researched subjects, in valorizing what was already valorized, in reconquering what had long been conquered and reconquered. He was at heart a pioneer, a discoverer, a master of uncharted scholarly terrain in an age when so many things art historical were thought to be understood."--<i>From the preface by Marvin Trachtenberg</i><br> ?</p></p><p><b>Richard Krautheimer</b> was Professor at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.

Now, in <em>Embattled Dreams</em>, the sixth volume in this monumental work, Starr looks at 1940s California, the war years and their aftermath.<br> California in the years surrounding World War II was a time of sweeping change, drama and intrigue, heroism and tragedy, a decade that saw the emergence of a new, more powerful role for California in the nation. Starr captures this exciting era with his unique vision and masterful prose. He describes the vast expansion of the war industry and California's role as "arsenal of democracy" (especially the significant part women played in the aviation industry). He examines the politics of the state: Earl Warren as the dominant political figure, the anti-communist movement and "red baiting," and the early career of Richard Nixon. He also looks at culture, ranging from Hollywood, to the counterculture with Henry Miller at Big Sur, to film noir and the fiction of Raymond Chandler. And he illuminates the harassment of Japanese immigrants and the shameful treatment of other minorities, especially Hispanics and blacks.<br> <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> hailed Starr as "the foremost chronicler of that often fabulous region, imposing upon the dramatic elements of California history a novelist's imagination and a cosmopolitan and sophisticated intelligence." In <em>Embattled Dreams</em>, Starr provides an unforgettable portrait of California, a spell-binding account of the state as it transformed itself from a regional power to the dominant economic, social, and cultural force in the nation.</p><p><br><strong>Kevin Starr</strong> is the State Librarian of California. He also holds the rank of University Professor in the Department of History at the University of Southern California.<br><br>"The scope of Starr's scholarship is breathtaking; this is a social, economic, political, and cultural history that covers such disparate subjects as popular San Francisco restaurants, shipbuilding, changes in domestic architecture, Raymond Chandler's fiction, the roots of anti-Japanese sentiment, baseball's Pacific Coast League, and the rise of Richard Nixon."--Ben Schwarz, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em><p></p><br>"This is ebullient, nuanced, interdisciplinary history of the grandest kind, drawing parallels and distinctions where perhaps no one ever thought to see them before. Starr's a born storyteller as well, mining a rich seam of anecdotal coal to animate the complex, enigmatic figures California history bustles with.... Starr is an undervalued and irreplaceable public treasure."--David Kipen, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"For ambition, narrative drive and breadth of research across the disciplines from culture through politics and demography to agronomy and water management, no recent project of American historical writing comes close to Kevin Starr's mammoth, multi-volume "Americans and the California Dream".... It is a magnificent accomplishment.... Starr's project all along has been at least as concerned with the California of the imagination as with the California of fact and has assumed that realities do begin in dreams.... Starr is at least as good a narrator of nightmares as he is of the beauties, successes or accomplishments of the California experience."--David Rieff, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"An exciting picture of how California changed during World War II, yet remained irrepressibly the same. Kevin Starr has captured the whole cockeyed chiaroscuro, with a novelist's eye for the telling detail, and a historian's grasp of the sweep of grand events. From the Hollywood Canteen to the Black Dahlia mystery, from the plight of the Okies and the Japanese to the gargantuan military buildup and the Golden State's bone-deep frivolity, he's got it all down. I was there, and I know. I read the book with absorbed admiration." --Herman Wouk, Pulitzer Prize winning author of <em>The Caine</em> <em>Mutiny</em> and <em>The Winds of War</em><p></p><br>"Kevin Starr is an absolutely wonderful writer, passionate, learned, born, as they said of Samuel Johnson, to wrestle with whole libraries. In <em>Embattled Dreams</em>, he has surpassed himself. This is his best book yet." --Max Byrd, author and Professor of English, UC Davis<p></p><br>"No one knows the shadows and light of the California Dream better than Kevin Starr. World war and political repression brought darkness to the dream, but Starr reminds us of what makes California compelling, as the home of American heartbreak and American promise." --Virginia Scharff, Director, Center for the Southwest, University of New Mexico<p></p><br>"California, in all its mythical splendor and promise, is in fact America stripped naked of myth. That is why Kevin Starr, who knows and recites California's epic better than anyone, must be judged one of America's finest living historians. Read all six of his volumes and lose your dreams...in dreams." --Walter A. McDougall, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age</em><p></p><br>"The 1940s, that decade of wars both hot and cold, changed California more than any other era in history. Kevin Starr leaves nothing out. Here are the shifting politics and populations, the burgeoning shipyards and aircraft factories, the movies, the novels--the whole culture of this exciting society in profound transition. How does he focus so much detail into such a lively, driving narrative?" --Stephen Fender, Research Professor of American Studies, University of Sussex<p></p><br></p><h2>Ecology: Concepts and Applications</h2><p>ISBN: 9781260085150 is an International Student Edition of Ecology: Concepts and Applications 8th Edition by Manuel Molles (Author), Anna Sher (Author) This ISBN 9781260085150 is Textbook only.

They advance many reasons for this pattern, some more plausible than others. In fact, although warfare is typically conducted by men, in various places and at various times, women have fought bravely and well, and in the West African kingdom of Dahomey during the nineteenth century, they formed the elite corps of a successful army. Many European visitors to Dahomey commented favorably on their military bearing, finding them more impressive in discipline and maneuver than male Dahomean soldiers. When France invaded Dahomey in the early 1890s, their superior weapons won the war but all those French officers and men who wrote about their bloody battles against Dahomey declared not only that these women warriors were superior to male Dahomean soldiers, but that they were the equal of the French. Edgerton describes the history of these &#x201d;Amazon,&#x201d; as they became known, their recruitment, training, and battle experience. Of particular interest to scholars interested in culture and gender today, these women believed that in order for them to carry out their martial roles, they had to transform themselves into men. How this was done, how the Amazons lived and fought, and what their experiences might mean for the understanding of women and warfare both in the past and present day are the subjects of this book.</p><p>Although warfare is typically conducted by men, in various places and at various times women have fought bravely and well, and in the West African kingdom of Dahomey during the 19th century, they formed the elite corps of a successful army.

The seventh edition again blends historical, rhetorical, and social psychological approaches to persuasion theory. The engaging discussions and multiple examples introduce the intricacies of social influence and highlight methods of presentation as well as evaluation.<p> The dynamic topic of persuasion presents a constantly changing palette for analysis. The authors dissect theory and practice in multiple contexts from interpersonal interactions to public communication and persuasive campaigns to advertising to politics. Twitter, YouTube, and social networking sites offer new media for persuasive appeals. The means of persuading one another changes constantly, yet much of what was written by Aristotle continues to be relevant. The production of persuasive messages and the study of message effects have been and will continue to be fertile ground for exploration.</p><p> Persuasion is an interactive process requiring willing and attentive participants. Becoming responsible, ethical, and credible persuaders involves systematic thinking and informed preparation. The skills required for planning, composing, and delivering effective messages are equally useful for evaluating messages received. The seventh edition provides a thorough, up-to-date discussion of classic and contemporary theories of persuasion to aid readers in developing skills as effective persuaders and as critical consumers of persuasive messages.</p><p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Borchers, <i>Persuasion in the Media Age,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577668268); Bowers et al., <i>The Rhetoric of Agitation and Control,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577666141); Denton-Kuypers, <i>Politics and Communication in America: Campaigns, Media, and Governing in the 21st Century</i> (ISBN 9781577665335); Johannesen et al., <i>Ethics in Human Communication,</i> Sixth Edition (ISBN 9781577665557); and Stewart et al., <i>Persuasion and Social Movements,</i> Sixth Edition (ISBN 9781577667773).</p></p><p>"Excellent, as usual!" --Lawrence J.

Alert readers will note that something's fishy and may even begin to spot the clues the first time through--even though a second reading will definitely be in order. But the book is still confusing even after another look, and its picture-book format seems too young for kids old enough to follow what's happening. The dramatic jacket and colorful illustrations will attract younger children, but parents of preschoolers may find it tricky to explain that the robin faked his own death to deflect suspicion, then hid the jewels in his coffin to dig up later. In the end, justice prevails, and O'Malley provides young detectives with a list of the visual clues that lead to Cock Robin's capture. As they say about British mysteries, "Too clever by half." <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>A mystery in the classic style, written in verse that mimics the familiar rhyme. A haughty detective--an owl in a pince-nez- -gets a confession from a sparrow plus an eye-witness account from a gardener/magpie; still, it's not so simple--an apparently unrelated jewel heist is involved. Small sleuths will enjoy picking up the clues in the illustrations, though the parody of adult mysteries will surely elude them. O'Malley's brash, bold art is nicely peopled with suspicious looking birds and caricatures, like the old turkey presiding at the trial. Not as cleverly plotted or as elegantly illustrated as Yolen's Piggins series, but with much of the same appeal. (Picture book. 5-8) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It avoids highly mathematical arguments, and features an abundance of examples and worked problems throughout the book. <b></b> Chapter topics include the Laplace transform; mathematical modeling of mechanical systems, electrical systems, fluid systems, and thermal systems; transient and steady-state-response analyses, root-locus analysis and control systems design by the root-locus method; frequency-response analysis and control systems design by the frequency-response; two-degrees-of-freedom control; state space analysis of control systems and design of control systems in state space. <b></b> For control systems engineers. </p></p><p><p> This book presents a comprehensive treatment of the analysis and design of control systems. It is written at the level of the senior engineering (mechanical, electrical, aerospace, and chemical) student and is intended to be used as a text for the first course in control systems. The prerequisite on the part of the reader is that he or she has had introductory courses on differential equations, vector-matrix analysis, circuit analysis, and mechanics. </p> <p> The main revision made in the fourth edition of the text is to present two-degrees-of-freedom control systems to design high performance control systems such that steady-state errors in following step, ramp, and acceleration inputs become zero. Also, newly presented is the computational (MATLAB) approach to determine the pole-zero locations of the controller to obtain the desired transient response characteristics such that the maximum overshoot and settling time in the step response be within the specified values. These subjects are discussed in Chapter 10. Also, Chapter 5 (primarily transient response analysis) and Chapter 12 (primarily pole placement and observer design) are expanded using MATLAB. Many new solved problems are added to these chapters so that the reader will have a good understanding of the MATLAB approach to the analysis and design of control systems. Throughout the book computational problems are solved with MATLAB. </p> <p> This text is organized into 12 chapters. The outline of the book is as follows. Chapter 1 presents an introduction to control systems. Chapter 2 deals with Laplace transforms of commonly encountered time functions and some of the useful theorems on Laplace transforms. (If the students have an adequate background on Laplace transforms, this chapter may be skipped.) Chapter 3 treats mathematical modeling of dynamic systems (mostly mechanical, electrical, and electronic systems) and develops transfer function models and state-space models. This chapter also introduces signal flow graphs. Discussions of a linearization technique for nonlinear mathematical models are included in this chapter. </p> <p> Chapter 4 presents mathematical modeling of fluid systems (such as liquid-level systems, pneumatic systems, and hydraulic systems) and thermal systems. Chapter 5 treats transient response analyses of dynamic systems to step, ramp, and impulse inputs. MATLAB is extensively used for transient response analysis. Routh's stability criterion is presented in this chapter for the stability analysis of higher order systems. Steady-state error analysis of unity-feedback control systems is also presented in this chapter. </p> <p> Chapter 6 treats the root-locus analysis of control systems. Plotting root loci with MATLAB is discussed in detail. In this chapter root-locus analyses of positive-feedback systems, conditionally stable systems, and systems with transport lag are included. Chapter 7 presents the design of lead, lag, and lag-lead compensators with the root-locus method. Both series and parallel compensation techniques are discussed. </p> <p> Chapter 8 presents basic materials on frequency-response analysis. Bode diagrams, polar plots, the Nyquist stability criterion, and closed-loop frequency response are discussed including the MATLAB approach to obtain frequency response plots. Chapter 9 treats the design and compensation techniques using frequency-response methods. Specifically, the Bode diagram approach to the design of lead, lag, and lag-lead compensators is discussed in detail. </p> <p> Chapter 10 first deals with the basic and modified PID controls and then presents computational (MATLAB) approach to obtain optimal choices of parameter values of controllers to satisfy requirements on step response characteristics. Next, it presents two-degrees-of-freedom control systems. The chapter concludes with the design of high performance control systems that will follow a step, ramp, or acceleration input without steady-state error. The zero-placement method is used to accomplish such performance. </p> <p> Chapter 11 presents a basic analysis of control systems in state space. Concepts of controllability and observability are given here. This chapter discusses the transformation of system models (from transfer-function model to state-space model, and vice versa) with MATLAB. Chapter 12 begins with the pole placement design technique, followed by the design of state observers. Both full-order and minimum-order state observers are treated. Then, designs of type 1 servo systems are discussed in detail. Included in this chapter are the design of regulator systems with observers and design of control systems with observers. Finally, this chapter concludes with discussions of quadratic optimal regulator systems. </p> <p> In this book, the basic concepts involved are emphasized and highly mathematical arguments are carefully avoided in the presentation of the materials. Mathematical proofs are provided when they contribute to the understanding of the subjects presented. All the material has been organized toward a gradual development of control theory. </p> <p> Throughout the book, carefully chosen examples are presented at strategic points so that the reader will have a clear understanding of the subject matter discussed. In addition, a number of solved problems (A-problems) are provided at the end of each chapter, except Chapter 1. These solved problems constitute an integral part of the text. Therefore, it is suggested that the reader study all these problems carefully to obtain a deeper understanding of the topics discussed. In addition, many problems (without solutions) of various degrees of difficulty are provided (B-problems). These problems may be used as homework or quiz purposes. An instructor using this text can obtain a complete solutions manual (for B-problems) from the publisher. </p> <p> Most of the materials including solved and unsolved problems presented in this book have been class tested in senior level courses on control systems at the University of Minnesota. </p> <p> If this book is used as a text for a quarter course (with 40 lecture hours), most of the materials in the first 10 chapters (except perhaps Chapter 4) may be covered. The first nine chapters cover all basic materials of control systems normally required in a first course on control systems. Many students enjoy studying computational (MATLAB) approach to the design of control systems presented in Chapter 10. It is recommended that Chapter 10 be included in any control courses. If this book is used as a text for a semester course (with 56 lecture hours), all or a good part of the book may be covered with flexibility in skipping certain subjects. Because of the abundance of solved problems (A-problems) that might answer many possible questions that the reader might have, this book can also serve as a self-study book for practicing engineers who wish to study basic control theory. </p> <p> I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Professors Athimoottil V Mathew (Rochester Institute of Technology), Richard Gordon (University of Mississippi), Guy Beale (George Mason University), and Donald T. Ward (Texas A &amp; M University), who made valuable suggestions at the early stage of the revision process, and anonymous reviewers who made many constructive comments. Appreciation is also due to my former students, who solved many of the A-problems and B-problems included in this book. </p> <p> <i>Katsuhiko Ogata</i> </p></p><h2>Medieval Combat: A Fifteenth-Century Illustrated Manual of Swordfighting and Close-Quarter Combat</h2><p>268 illustrations 6 x 9 This brilliant and attractive new book makes one of the most influential fencing manuals of the middle ages available in English for the first time.

Without a contemporary instructor as a guide, the drawings can seem arcane and confusing, since they lack explanatory captions. Rector, a founder of the Chicago Swordplay Guild, does provide an introduction and footnotes, and along the way gives practical clarification of German martial arts and a harsh, complex picture of medieval society (particularly medieval justice), if not of specific moves. Aside from their historical merit, Talhoffer's beautiful and austere illustrations provide a visual vocabulary of historical combat that might prove inspirational for directors, artists, re-enactors or stunt coordinators; others should not be surprised to find themselves posing in front of the nearest mirror. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Victimology: The Essentials</h2><p><p>Victimology: The Essentials, Second Edition, is a comprehensive yet concise core textbook that explores the effects of victimization in the United States and internationally, with an emphasis on vulnerable populations.

A broad, probing narrative, this book studies inflation as a strategy of social pacification and economic reconstruction and as a mechanism for escaping domestic and international indebtedness. <em>The Great Disorder</em> is a study of German society under the tension of inflation and hyperinflation, and it explores the ways in which Germany's hyperinflation and stabilization were linked to the Great Depression and the rise of National Socialism. This wide-ranging study sets German inflation within the broader issues of maintaining economic stability, social peace, and democracy and thus contributes to the general history of the twentieth century and has important implications for existing and emerging market economies facing the temptation or reality of inflation.<br></p><p>This book presents a comprehensive study of the most famous and spectacular instance of inflation in modern industrial society--that in Germany during and following World War I.Gerald D.

For John Stambaugh, this continuity of fabric, form, and function affords an extraordinary view of the ancient city, the experience of its inhabitants, and the Roman way of life. Exploring ancient Rome as both a physical and social environment, he has written the first extended survey of its development in English - and a vivid &#34;guidebook into the living past of one of the most emphatically urban cities the world has ever known.&#34;</p><p>Stambaugh aims at a comprehensive view of urban life in the ancient Roman world. Offering an overview of political history, liberally seasoned with a survey of the architectural development of Rome, he incorporates a catalog of the best known statesmen and authors; these figures are later invoked for the light they can shed on urban values and perspectives. The book's latter half provides a panorama of various aspects of Roman city living. The topography and the city's architecture provide a distinctive emphasis for an introductory account much like L. Richardson Jr.'s Pompeii: An Architectural History , which joins Stambaugh's in the new series "Ancient History and Society." James S.

Under the general editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shapiro, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the play.<br><br>Although it has been at times overshadowed by his more famous <em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em> and <em>Antigone</em>, Sophocles' <em>Electra</em> is remarkable for its extreme emotions and taut drama.<br><br><em>Electra</em> recounts the murders of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus by Clytemnestra's son Orestes, to avenge their murder of his father Agamemnon, commander of the Greeks at Troy, upon his return home. Sophocles' version is presented from the viewpoint of Electra, Orestes' sister, who laments her father, bears witness to her mother's crime, and for years endures her mother's scorn. Despite her overwhelming passion for just revenge, Electra admits that her own actions are shameful. When Orestes arrives at last, her mood shifts from grief to joy, as Orestes carries out the bloody vengeance.<br><br> Sophocles presents this story as a savage though necessary act of vengeance, vividly depicting Electra's grief, anger, and exultation. This translation equals the original in ferocity of expression, and leaves intact the inarticulate cries of suffering and joy that fill the play.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anne Carson</strong> is McNaughton Professor of Classics at McGill University, Canada. <strong>Michael Shaw</strong> is Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Kansas.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Joint Mobilization/Manipulation: Extremity and Spinal Techniques</h2><p>This highly illustrated text is the only book to include manipulation and mobilization techniques for both spine and extremity.

To honor her work and call attention to the significance of her contributions, Firebrand Books is publishing a new, expanded edition of her classic, Movement In Black.<p>With an incisive introduction by Cheryl Clarke, celebrations/ remembrances/tributes from ten outstanding African American women writers, and a dozen previously unpublished pieces, Movement In Black is a must read/ must have on your book shelf.</p><p>Whether she was presenting her poetry on street corners, performing with other women -- writers, musicians, activists -- in bars and auditoriums, rallying the crowd at political events, preaching to the converted, or converting the ill-informed, Pat Parker was a presence.</p><p>She wrote about gut issues: the lives of ordinary Black people, violence, loving women, the legacy of her African American heritage, being queer. She was a woman who engaged life fully, both personally and as a political activist, linking the struggles for racial, gender, sexual, and class equality long before it was "PC" to do so. She died as she lived -- fighting forces larger than herself.</p><p>The publication of Movement In Black is an opportunity, both for those who were around the first time and those who are new to her work, to experience and enjoy Pat Parker's power.</p></p><p>This is the new, expanded edition of a groundbreaking volume of poetry first published in 1978, 11 years before Parker's early death of breast cancer. Based in the Bay Area and steeped in the radical politics of the late 1960s, Parker was the contemporary of Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka. In her introduction, Cheryl Clarke identifies Parker as a "lead voice and caller" in the lesbian-feminist cultural scene, but chides her for careless editing, as if Parker feared that her vernacular poems would lose their power if she subjected them to cold critique. Her most potent works do rely on an inspired punch line rather than carefully plumed images or language, as in "For Willyce," when she describes making love to a woman: <p> </p><blockquote> and your sounds drift down<br> oh god!<br> oh jesus!<br> and i think<br> here it is, some dude's<br> getting credit for what<br> a woman<br> has done<br> again. </blockquote><p> A distinguished collection, including previously unpublished work and tributes from many of Parker's friends and allies. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Autumn Morning<br> Best Friends<br> The Best Nightmares<br> Between The Light<br> Break-up<br> Brother<br> Child Of Myself<br> Conflagration<br> Cop-out<br> Desire<br> Dialogue<br> Don't Let The Fascists Speak<br> Exodus<br> A Family Tree<br> For Donna<br> For Michael On His Third Birthday<br> For The Straight Folks Who Don't Mind Gays But Wish They Weren't So<br> For The White Person Who Wants To Know How To Be My Friend<br> For Willyce<br> From Deep Within<br> Fuller Brush Day<br> Funny<br> Gente<br> Goat Child: 1. 1944-1956<br> Goat Child: 2. 1956-1962<br> Goat Child: 3. 1962-1966<br> Great God<br> Group<br> Have You Ever Tried To Hide?<br> I Have<br> I Kumquat You<br> I Wish That I Could Hate You<br> It's A Simple Dream<br> It's Not So Bad<br> Language<br> The Law<br> Let Me<br> Massage<br> Metamorphosis<br> A Moment Left Behind<br> Move In Darkness<br> Movement In Black<br> My Hands Are Big And Rough<br> My Lady Ain't No Lady<br> My Lover Is A Woman<br> Non-monogamy Is A Pain In The Butt<br> On Jealousy<br> Para Maria Sandra<br> Pied Piper<br> Pit Stop<br> Progeny<br> Questions<br> Reality<br> Reputation<br> A Small Contradiction<br> Snatches Of A Day<br> Sobriety<br> Solitary Lover<br> Sometimes My Husband Acts Just Like A Man<br> Sublimation<br> Sunday<br> Sunshine<br> Talk Is Cheap<br> There Is A Woman In This Town<br> To My Vegetarian Friend<br> To See A Man Cry<br> Tour America!<br> The What Liberation Front?<br> Where Do You Go To Become A Non-citizen?<br> Where Will You Be?<br> Who Is This Bitch?<br> Womanslaughter<br> Yes Ma'am<br> You Can't Be Sure Of Anything These Days<br> -- <i>Table of Poems from Poem Finder�</i></p><h2>Glaciers and Glaciation</h2><p>Most of us only encounter ice in the winter or as small blocks in drinks, and in this form it appears rigid and brittle. In glaciers, ice behaves in a variety of surprising and fascinating ways - flowing plastically, like toothpaste, carving out huge troughs and altering entire landscapes; changing the Earth's climate, and preserving valuable geological records. Either directly ot indirectly, glaciers and glaciation affect a large proportion of this planet's population.<br>This major new text provides a synthesis of the nature, origin and behaviour of glacier systems and the geological and geomorphlological evidence for their former existence. The first part of the book investigates the processes involved in forming glacier ice, the nature of glacier/climate relationships, the mechanisms of glacier flow, and the interactions of glaciers with other systems such as slopes, rivers, lakes and oceans. In the second part, emphasis is placed on landform/sediment associations, the interpretation of the earth's glacial legacy, and the reconstruction of glacial depositional environments and palaeoglaciology.<br>Glaciers and Glaciation features a superb collection of colour and black and white photographs, over 300 in all, together with over 450 line diagrams. Using case studies drawn from around the world, it is referenced throughout and concludes with a fully comprehensive bibliography.

Anderson takes readers there--to the experience of first fieldwork. Written with wit and insight, fifteen chapters (each exploring a key anthropological concept) chronicle daily life in a Danish maritime community. From the arrival of the Anderson family to their eventful departure, readers follow the professional and personal challenges of a culture change study. Forces of urbanization are turning the life (but not the soul) of thatched-roof Taarnby from the sea to the nearby city of Copenhagen. From cooking and culture shock to data gathering and childbirth, <i>First Fieldwork</i> animates the lighter side of fieldwork, its follies and foibles, triumphs and disasters. Anyone who has done fieldwork will identify with the humor and the pathos; anyone planning it will profit from the demystification that Anderson brings to this anthropological rite of passage.

Virginia ultimately manages to reveal much more&gt; For it is the beginning behind these daily events-that give Mrs. Dalloway its texture and richness and make it so memorable.</p><p>As Clarissa Dalloway walks through London on a fine June morning, a sky-writing plane captures her attention. Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Like the airplane's swooping path, Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> follows Clarissa and those whose lives brush hers--from Peter Walsh, whom she spurned years ago, to her daughter Elizabeth, the girl's angry teacher, Doris Kilman, and war-shocked Septimus Warren Smith, who is sinking into madness.<p> As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for the party she is giving that evening, a series of events intrudes on her composure. Her husband is invited, without her, to lunch with Lady Bruton (who, Clarissa notes anxiously, gives the most amusing luncheons). Meanwhile, Peter Walsh appears, recently from India, to criticize and confide in her. His sudden arrival evokes memories of a distant past, the choices she made then, and her wistful friendship with Sally Seton.</p><p> Woolf then explores the relationships between women and men, and between women, as Clarissa muses, "It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.... Her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?" While Clarissa is transported to past afternoons with Sally, and as she sits mending her green dress, Warren Smith catapults desperately into his delusions. Although his troubles form a tangent to Clarissa's web, they undeniably touch it, and the strands connecting all these characters draw tighter as evening deepens. As she immerses us in each inner life, Virginia Woolf offers exquisite, painful images of the past bleeding into the present, of desire overwhelmed by society's demands. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>This edition of Mrs. Dalloway includes substantial explanatory notes compiling past scholarship while identifying new allusions, and a list of textual variants among all editions in Woolf&#39;s lifetime. It also features a composition history, documenting how Woolf&#39;s reading, friendships, and culture contributed to the book, and Woolf&#39;s seldom-reprinted 1928 introduction.</p><h2>New Testament in Modern English (Student Edition) (English and Ancient Greek Edition)</h2><p>Edited by J.B.

In the 1990s he and his colleagues made headlines with the discovery that the last ice age came to an abrupt end over a period of only three years. Here Alley offers the first popular account of the wildly fluctuating climate that characterized most of prehistory--long deep freezes alternating briefly with mild conditions--and explains that we humans have experienced an unusually temperate climate. But, he warns, our comfortable environment could come to an end in a matter of years.</p><p><i>The Two-Mile Time Machine</i> begins with the story behind the extensive research in Greenland in the early 1990s, when scientists were beginning to discover ancient ice as an archive of critical information about the climate. Drilling down two miles into the ice, they found atmospheric chemicals and dust that enabled them to construct a record of such phenomena as wind patterns and precipitation over the past 110,000 years. The record suggests that "switches" as well as "dials" control the earth's climate, affecting, for example, hot ocean currents that today enable roses to grow in Europe farther north than polar bears grow in Canada. Throughout most of history, these currents switched on and off repeatedly (due partly to collapsing ice sheets), throwing much of the world from hot to icy and back again in as little as a few years.</p><p>Alley explains the discovery process in terms the general reader can understand, while laying out the issues that require further study: What are the mechanisms that turn these dials and flip these switches? Is the earth due for another drastic change, one that will reconfigure coastlines or send certain regions into severe drought? Will global warming combine with natural variations in Earth's orbit to flip the North Atlantic switch again? Predicting the long-term climate is one of the greatest challenges facing scientists in the twenty-first century, and Alley tells us what we need to know in order to understand and perhaps overcome climate changes in the future.</p></p><p><br><p>"<i>The Two-Mile Time Machine</i> takes a story that has been much discussed in the press and revitalizes it with the author's infectious enthusiasm and with background information on the history of ice core drilling. It provides an excellent survey for the general reader and those interested in the history of scientific exploration and issues related to science and society."<b>--Thomas J. Crowley, Texas A &amp; M University</b><br></p><br><p>"Richard Alley takes the reader from the rationale for the study of ice sheets to the story of how ice cores are recovered and how we read the climate and environment of the past recorded therein.

To familiarize readers with the ideas for which Jung is best known, the British psychiatrist and writer Anthony Storr has selected extracts from Jung's writings that pinpoint his many original contributions and relate the development of his thought to his biography. Dr. Storr has prefaced each extract with explanatory notes. These notes link the extracts, and with Dr. Storr's introduction, they show the progress and coherence of Jung's ideas, including such concepts as the collective unconscious, the archetypes, introversion and extroversion, individuation, and Jung's view of integration as the goal of the development of the personality.</p></p><p><b>Anthony Storr</b> is Consultant Psychotherapist, Oxfordshire Area, and Clinical Lecturer in Psychiatry, University of Oxford.

Yet a formally educated man like Ben Jonson was unable to make these ornaments come to life in his two classical Roman plays. Garry Wills, focusing his attention on <i>Julius Caesar</i>, here demonstrates how Shakespeare so wonderfully made these ancient devices vivid, giving his characters their own personal styles of Roman speech.</p><p>In four chapters, devoted to four of the play&#x2019;s main characters, Wills shows how Caesar, Brutus, Antony, and Cassius each has his own take on the rhetorical ornaments that Elizabethans learned in school. Shakespeare also makes Rome present and animate by casting his troupe of experienced players to make their strengths shine through the historical facts that Plutarch supplied him with. The result is that the Rome English-speaking people carry about in their minds is the Rome that Shakespeare created for them. And that is even true, Wills affirms, for today&#x2019;s classical scholars with access to the original Roman sources.</p></p><p><p><b>Garry Wills</b> is professor of history emeritus at Northwestern University.

Now, another nuclear crisis looms over this region: the storage of tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste. <em>Tainted</em> <em>Desert</em> maps the nuclear landscapes of the US inter-desert southwest, a land sacrificed to the Cold-War arms race and nuclear energy policy.</p><p><strong>Valerie L. Kuletz</strong>, the daughter of a weapons scientist, grew up near a Department of Defense research and testing center in the Mojave Desert. She has taught at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and currently is Lecturer in American Studies at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Her work on this book won the American Sociological Association's 1997 Robert Boguslaw Award for Technology and Humanism.Nuclear waste meets Native American folkways in this garbled account of desert ecopolitics. Kuletz (Univ. of Canterbury, New Zealand) has turned her doctoral dissertation into a book, and its origins are evident. The text bristles with jargon and zigzags over a vast swath of territory, without settling on a single narrative path. At the heart of her discussion is a truism, well reported in the current literature: The American West has long been seen, at least by the powers in Washington, as a dusty outback that is just right for testing nuclear weapons and dumping toxic wastes of various kinds (``these dry, arid regions are perceived and discursively interpreted as marginal within the dominant Euroamerican perspective''). That outback is the domain of Indians, who view it differently, as sacred geography; thus, Kuletz's argument follows, the government's misuse of Western lands is a form of environmental racism (``Those who benefit least from nuclear developments end up paying the highest price for the excesses of our nuclear culture''). More interestingly, but not necessarily to the point, Kuletz is interested in mapping out the spiritual geography of groups like the Western Shoshone and Paiute, who live near threatened places like Yucca Mountain, Nev.; traditionalists among these people consider the ecological despoliation wrought by nuclear-waste dumping and weapons testing to be a desecration. Kuletz does a solid job of presenting their views, but she doesn't pursue the harder story: Tribal medicine elders don't command much respect in Washington, but tribal attorneys do, and these attorneys have made concessions for half a century to allow the testing and dumping Kuletz rightly decries in places like Alamogordo and Fallon. Solid scholarship that doesn't translate into readable or pointed argument. (5 b&amp;w photos, 24 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

On the other hand, she does not exactly fit in with the band of Japanese office ladies she's accompanied, who have traveled to the United States for a week's worth of shopping. Still, everything seems to be going well enough, until one of the kimonos is stolen from her hotel room and Rei's passport shows up in a Dumpster behind a shopping mall -- on the dead body of one of the office ladies. In the middle of this, Rei's ex-boyfriend, Hugh Glendinning, inexplicably arrives in town.</p><p>The Bride's Kimono takes us on an utterly absorbing ride as Rei tries to find the stolen kimono, uncover its significance in an ancient Japanese love triangle, decide between two men, and unmask a murderer. <em>The Bride's Kimono</em> is Sujata Massey's strongest novel yet -- sexy and suspenseful, deftly balancing mystery, murder, romance, and culture shock with an alluring historical subplot involving priceless kimonos.</p></p><p>Sujata Massey's lively bicultural series featuring Rei Shimura, the Tokyo antique dealer who can't seem to keep out of trouble, brings her heroine back to her American roots in this engaging tale of corruption and chicanery in the museum exhibition game. Rei is unexpectedly invited to accompany a treasure trove of antique kimonos to a Washington, D.C., museum and to deliver a couple of lectures on the cultural history of the gorgeous garments. A last-minute decision to substitute a priceless wedding kimono for one that's too fragile to travel sets in motion a chain of events that lands Rei in serious peril.<p> When Rei's former boyfriend, Scottish attorney Hugh Glendinning, turns up at the Washington museum, she's caught up in a romantic crisis, having just settled into a new relationship with Takeo Kayama, the Japanese playboy she met two books ago (in <i>The Flower Master</i>). But that dilemma is soon eclipsed by the theft of the wedding kimono, which was uninsured, and by the disappearance of Rei's seatmate on the flight from Japan. When the seatmate's dead body and Rei's passport and tickets turn up in a Washington dumpster, Rei is suspected of murder, larceny, and even prostitution. Through all this, Massey does a nice job of imparting a wealth of fascinating information on the kimono tradition.</p><p> Rei gets more appealing with every outing, and in this one Massey ratchets up the romantic tension and action--maybe because Rei's in a country that's more obsessed with sex than with tradition. Nicely plotted, well characterized, and carefully crafted, this may be Massey's best yet. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Sujata Massey was a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em> and spent several years in Japan teaching English and studying Japanese.

Through vintage photographs, advertisements, cartoons, and songs, <em>Wheels of Change</em> transports young readers to bygone eras to see how women used the bicycle to improve their lives. Witty in tone and scrapbook-like in presentation, the book deftly covers early (and comical) objections, influence on fashion, and impact on social change inspired by the bicycle, which, according to Susan B. Anthony, "has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world."<br><strong> <strong>Q&amp;A with Sue Macy, Author of Wheels of Change</strong><br><br> Q: Who taught you how to ride a bike? What did it feel like when you took your first one for a spin?</strong><br> A: My dad taught me how to ride a two-wheeler. (He later taught me to drive a car.) I remember him taking me to a paved, pretty empty parking lot at a nearby park. It was a great feeling to be able to move and balance without training wheels, but I was also worried about falling. I don&#x2019;t think I did fall, though.<br><br> <strong>Q: Why are bikes still important to women?</strong><br> A: I think that Leah Missbach Day does a great job in the foreword to Wheels of Change of explaining how bicycles are still important to one population of women--those in developing countries who are able to increase their mobility astronomically with the bicycles they received through World Bicycle Relief. But today in the U.S., bicycles are important to everybody. They allow people to do errands without using fossil fuels, to get great cardiovascular exercise, to see their surroundings in a whole new way. My neighborhood isn&#x2019;t great for cycling--too much traffic and too many hills--but I try to ride at least once a week in the spring, summer, and fall, usually stopping at a nearby farmers' market to restock on fruits and vegetables. It&#x2019;s a healthy way to live.<br><br> <strong>Q: What&#x2019;s your favorite thing about the very first bicycle models?</strong><br> A: I love the ordinaries, which weren&#x2019;t the first models but rather the ones that started appearing in the 1870s, with the very large front wheel and the smaller real wheel. I love the look of them; they&#x2019;re such a wonderful evocation of a time in history. When you see one, you&#x2019;re automatically transported back to that time period; but I wouldn&#x2019;t want to ride one. When I was visiting Dottie Batho, who contributed more than 20 images to Wheels of Change, I tried to hoist myself onto the seat of the ordinary that she has in her living room and I was scared to do even that. It was her late husband&#x2019;s bike and she said the first time he rode it, he fell head first over the front wheel and broke both his wrists!<br><br> <strong>Q: How is the bicycle going to change the future?</strong><br> A: I really do think more and more people will go back to the bicycle as a replacement for cars and other types of local transportation and hopefully, towns and cities will start designating more space for cyclists to ride. The efforts of the Portland, Oregon, city government to make bicycling an integral part of daily life have been well-publicized, but even New York City has been installing 50 miles of bike lanes per year with the goal of having an 1,800-mile network of bike lanes by 2030. Cycling is a great way to get around and a great way to keep healthy.<br><br> <strong>Q: What are kids going to love most about this book?</strong><br> A: Wheels of Change is a lively book full of awesome characters and its design is very appealing. I love the stories of the bicycle racers, most of whom had been lost to history until now. Their bravura and tenacity was pretty amazing. I think kids also will love the images--especially the bicycle artifacts from the 1800s--because they will help kids visual what the period was all about. Plus, there are news clips about female cyclists in every chapter, reproduced verbatim, and some of them are wild. My favorite is &#x201c;Don&#x2019;ts for Women Wheelers&#x201d; on page 38.<br><br> <strong>Q: How has fashion evolved around the bicycle? Do you think dresses and high heels impede a woman&#x2019;s ability to feel completely free?</strong><br> A: The advent of the bicycles in the late 1800s caused a fashion revolution for women because it made the need for comfortable, safe clothing for cyclists crucial. And once women started casting aside corsets and other oppressive fashion architecture, they realized there was much to be said for simpler clothing. I completely understand this evolution because, as a writer who works from home, I go for comfort over fashion most of the time.

Zygmunt Bauman explores the silences found in debates about the Holocaust, and asks what the historical facts of the Holocaust tell us about the hidden capacities of present-day life. He finds great danger in such phenomena as the seductiveness of martyrdom; going to extremes in the name of safety; the insidious effects of tragic memory; and efficient, "scientific" implementation of the death penalty. Bauman writes, "Once the problem of the guilt of the Holocaust perpetrators has been by and large settled . . . the one big remaining question is the innocence of all the rest&#x2015;not the least the innocence of ourselves."Among the conditions that made the mass extermination of the Holocaust possible, according to Bauman, the most decisive factor was modernity itself. Bauman's provocative interpretation counters the tendency to reduce the Holocaust to an episode in Jewish history, or to one that cannot be repeated in the West precisely because of the progressive triumph of modern civilization. He demonstrates, rather, that we must understand the events of the Holocaust as deeply rooted in the very nature of modern society and in the central categories of modern social thought.</p><p>Sociology is concerned with modern society, but has never come to terms with one of the most distinctive and horrific aspects of modernity - the Holocaust. <p>The book examines what sociology can teach us about the Holocaust, but more particularly concentrates upon the lessons which the Holocaust has for sociology. Bauman's work demonstrates that the Holocaust has to be understood as deeply involved with the nature of modernity. There is nothing comparable to this work available in the sociological literature.</p>Zygmunt Bauman (1925-2017) was Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the Universities of Leeds and Warsaw. He is the author of many works including Legislators and Interpreters (Polity Press) and Modernity and Ambivalence (Polity Press). He was also awarded the Theodor W. Adorno Prize in 1998.</p><h2>The Economy of Character: Novels, Market Culture, and the Business of Inner Meaning</h2><p><p>At the start of the eighteenth century, talk of literary "characters" referred as much to letters and typefaces as it did to persons in books. Yet by the nineteenth century, characters had become the equals of their readers, friends with whom readers might spend time and empathize.<br> <br> Although the story of this shift is usually told in terms of the "rise of the individual," Deidre Shauna Lynch proposes an ingenious alternative interpretation. Elaborating a "pragmatics of character," Lynch shows how readers used transactions with characters to accommodate themselves to newly commercialized social relations. Searching for the inner meanings of characters allowed readers both to plumb their own inwardness and to distinguish themselves from others. In a culture of mass consumption, argues Lynch, possessing a belief in the inexpressible interior life of a character rendered one's property truly private.<br> <br> Ranging from Defoe and Smollett to Burney and Austen, Lynch's account will interest students of the novel, literary historians, and anyone concerned with the inner workings of consumer culture and the history of emotions.<br></p></p><p><b>Deidre Shauna Lynch</b>&nbsp;is professor of English at Harvard University and the Chancellor Jackman Professor of English at the University of Toronto.</p><h2>Bach Flower Essences and Chinese Medicine</h2><p>A guide to applying the power and wisdom of Chinese Medicine to Bach Flower Therapy <br> <br>� Includes detailed write-ups about the indications and effects of each of the original 38 Bach flower remedies according to Chinese Medicine <br> <br>� Explains the relationships between specific emotions, symptoms, and regions of the body according to Chinese Medicine <br> <br>� Offers a complementary method of Flower Essence evaluation using physical conditions to access the emotions <br> <br>Bach flower essences provide excellent tools for balancing energetic disturbances generated by emotions. Yet people often have trouble clearly expressing their feelings and emotions, making selection of a specific flower essence difficult. Drawing upon the centuries-old relationships established in Chinese Medicine between emotions and physical disorders, Pablo Noriega shows how to use a person&#x2019;s descriptions of their complaints and chronic conditions combined with Flower-type personality traits to diagnose which flower essence to prescribe in each unique case. <br> <br>The author includes a full primer on Chinese Medicine, exploring in detail the main principles: Yin and Yang; the Five Elements and their associated Organs; Blood and Energy; the Virtues, the behaviors that can strengthen the Elements; and the Psyches, the energetic spirit of each Organ.

This intent to slow or detain the river of Energy has consequences that are expressed in different areas depending on the person&#x2019;s constitution and history. <br> <br>Introversion and shyness, fear, frustration, depressive states, and mistrust also harm this Organ. Ricardo Orozco, author of <i>Flores de Bach: 38 descripciones din�micas</i> [Bach Flower Remedies: 38 Dynamic Descriptions], says that bitterness and resentment is Mimulus&#x2019;s way of compensating for these states. Anxiety likewise creates imbalances in this and other Organs. <br> <br>When--as a consequence of the above-mentioned sentiments and modes--Energy, Blood, and Fluids do not circulate smoothly, rigidity of body and mind sets in. The characteristic softness of the Liver is lost. Fluids, and denser substances like mucus and cysts, may accumulate in various parts of the body. <br> <br>Persistent stagnation of Energy creates Heat, gestating an irritability that can evolve into resentment. <br> <br>The Liver&#x2019;s Psyche provides, among other aspects, the capacity for extroversion and the impulse for initiating action. If these qualities lack sufficient strength to be put into play, frustration is the emotion that naturally arises; this is a clear consequence of the inability to express one&#x2019;s plans, feelings, and opinions. <br><b> <br>The Spleen</b> <br> <br>The Mimulus-type person spends a great deal of time worrying. He attempts to prevent and control circumstances by anticipating them in thought. In the best possible case, these thoughts are a means of opposing fear with reason. <br> <br>The problem is that the Energy used for these processes comes from the Spleen, in detriment to food distribution and assimilation and likewise to the production and distribution of Blood and Energy. <br> <br>Debility in the Spleen&#x2019;s Psyche prepares the ground for a growth in shyness and sense of inferiority. <br> <br>A large portion of Mimulus&#x2019;s Energy is lost in the need to keep everything under as much control as possible. <br> <br><i><b>The Lung <br></b></i> <br>The pessimistic, negative contents of Mimulus&#x2019;s thoughts and worries impact this Organ. Excess introversion may originate as much in a deficient Liver Psyche as in disorders of the Lung&#x2019;s Psyche. When there is a deficiency in the latter, the ability to adapt to life&#x2019;s changes is lost, a tendency toward isolation grows, and the person is more vulnerable. <br> <br><i><b>The Kidney</b></i> <br> <br>The relationship between fear and the Kidneys is well known. <br> <br>Many people have observed that one of the effects of fear can be urinary incontinence. Fear causes Energy to descend. The legs and knees feel weak and shaky. The Kidney&#x2019;s Energy loses solidity and shrinks. <br> <br>Fear has many effects; it ages, takes away strength and immunity, deteriorates bones, delays the knitting of fractures, weakens the lumbar area, and, when it is extreme, creates paralysis (Rock Rose). <br> <br>If persistent, fear can upset one&#x2019;s growth rate, sexual vigor, and reproductive capacity. It can also create Blood deficiency disorders and imbalances in quantity, and frequency of urination. <br> <br>When edemas are present, we might consider fear as a factor. Shallow breathing may lead us in the same direction, as may asthma and respiratory fatigue. <br> <br>Weakness in the Kidney&#x2019;s Psyche will be found in areas related to authority, affirmation, and determination. This Psyche must be strengthened in order to gain security and reduce vulnerability. <br> <br>Kidney imbalances can be observed when fear-related emotions arise, such as apprehension, phobia, cowardice. <br> <br>Audacity can show up in some cases to compensate for retraction, but boldness is difficult to sustain as it uses up the little Energy that this personality type has in the first place. In other cases, as Ricardo Orozco mentions, a Vine attitude appears and may persist over time provided the person in question is not a Mimulus type with a weak Kidney constitution, evident in the person&#x2019;s fragile appearance (curved posture and paleness). This Organ is in charge of giving strength and solidity to the physical body. Bones are supported by Kidney Energy. <br><i><b> <br>Virtues <br></b></i> <br>Wisdom is the Virtue corresponding to the Kidney. It provides balance between excessive caution and daredevilry. This Organ also gives us the capacity to keep calm when posed with the fear that arises when facing the unknown. The Spleen bestows us with the capacity to maintain our integrity while at the same time paying attention to the exchange and distribution of vital Energy shared with another person, guaranteeing the integrity of both parties. <br> <br><b><i>Comments <br></i></b> <br>Heather essence can help the Mimulus person not be so self-centered in his worries. Other essences can help provide Energy, like Centaury, Clematis, and Olive, as well as those that help with stagnation, like Crab Apple, Willow, Chicory, and Cherry Plum. <br> <br>I agree with my colleague Josep Guarch when he says that Mimulus rejects himself, believing that others are going to evaluate him using the same measure; that is why he acts as Ricardo describes, &#x201c;with a clear Avoidant conduct meant to protect him from ridicule, humiliation, and above all, negative judgment and rejection.&#x201d; <br> <br>That which is unfathomable, dangerous, and mysterious finds its home in Water, and the Mimulus plant, as we see in its signature, lives at the edge of running water. The Mimulus person is often surprised to find that he has the strength and resources for facing that which he fears. At those times, like the plant, he deepens his roots so he won&#x2019;t be carried away in the current.</p><h2>A Transition to Advanced Mathematics</h2><p>This book should be of interest to students on courses in advanced mathematics and calculus.</p><p>The authors are the leaders in this course area.

She shows how, in just three decades, state leaders in Latin America, Europe, and Africa have lost their immunity from any accountability for their human rights violations, becoming the subjects of highly publicized trials resulting in severe consequences. This shift is affecting the behavior of political leaders worldwide and may change the face of global politics as we know it.</p><p>Sikkink presents her groundbreaking quantitative research to analyze the effects this &#x201c;justice cascade&#x201d; has had on democracy, conflict, and repression and reveals what political and social conditions are and aren&#x2019;t required for human rights trials to be effective.

In this book, Charles Sykes asks why, and lays most of the blame at the feet of the trainers of teachers, the writers of textbooks and the educational policy wonks who influence them. He convincingly shows that in many different school systems, and in many different academic fields, with the help of goofy text-books, watered-down requirements and &#34;recentered&#34; test grade scales, American students have come to value feeling good about a subject over being good in it. Sykes&#39;s recommended reforms include abolishing the federal Department of Education and its state counterparts, abolishing undergraduate schools of education, establishing more alternative routes to teacher certification and merit raises for good teachers.

Jackson Hole is a bit off the beaten path when it comes to snow-skiing resorts, so the town isn&#x2019;t overdeveloped with fast-food restaurants, nor are the slopes jam-packed like a shopping mall on the day after Thanksgiving. It&#x2019;s still a relatively unspoiled Eden, where the local elk population outnumbers the tourists.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of my favorite ski runs at Jackson Hole is called Timbered Island. Just after you exit the lift, there&#x2019;s a spot so steep it&#x2019;s essentially a cliff face. As a matter of fact, if you stop on the catwalk and turn your skis downhill, the tips will jut out into thin air. However, that alarming pitch levels out into a gently sloped field flanked with towering pine trees.<br>&nbsp;<br>Therefore, if you&#x2019;re daring enough to go over the edge, you&#x2019;re rewarded by the feeling of flying&#x2014;of weightless freedom&#x2014;followed by cruising into a soft playground of white crystals. It is absolutely exhilarating! Every time I&#x2019;ve gasped in slightly terrified awe at the top, but I&#x2019;ve ended up laughing in sheer delight while zooming to the bottom.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet despite the spine-tingling payoff, I&#x2019;ve noticed that most skiers glide right past the precipice without stopping to consider the view, much less consider jumping off. Perhaps because the trail map designates Timbered Island as a &#x201c;blue run&#x201d; (which means the terrain is negotiable for skiers of average skill level), they&#x2019;re seeking a cushy, nonjarring ride. Maybe they&#x2019;ve become so accustomed to moderate inclines that they&#x2019;re not even tempted to consider a riskier, more vertical route. <br>&nbsp;<br>Choosing the safe but boring path is an apt metaphor for the years I spent rather numbly and halfheartedly pursuing God. As Francis Chan candidly describes in his book <i>Crazy Love,</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>I called myself a Christian, was pretty involved in church, and tried to stay away from all of the things that &#x201c;good Christians&#x201d; avoid&#x2014;drinking, drugs, sex, swearing. Christianity was simple: fight your desires in order to please God. Whenever I failed (which was often), I&#x2019;d walk around feeling guilty and distant from God. In hindsight, I don&#x2019;t think my church&#x2019;s teachings were incorrect, just incomplete. My view of God was narrow and small.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Thankfully, I came to a spiritual cliff face that challenged my small, narrow view of God. I got to the edge of who I&#x2019;d previously understood Jesus to be and risked going beyond it. And the reward has been much more liberating and exhilarating than anything I&#x2019;ve ever experienced on skis. Choosing to explore past the boundaries of my incomplete perception has led me to a bigger and better view of our Redeemer. I&#x2019;ve discovered Jesus to be much more confrontational and provocative than the pale imitation of Him I had settled for! <br>&nbsp;<br>As we explore some of His wilder aspects for the next two hundred or so pages together, I really hope you&#x2019;ll get a bigger and better view too. I hope you&#x2019;ll sense the Holy Spirit drawing you into a riskier, more intimate, and less religious relationship with Jesus. I hope that it&#x2019;ll reawaken the sense of adventure God hard-wired into your soul. That you&#x2019;ll find yourself awed by His power and glory and laugh out loud with sheer delight over the fact that this majestically untamed Savior is madly in love with you!<br>&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, although <i>Untamed </i>isn&#x2019;t formatted like a traditional Bible study, I hope it will encourage you to experience Scripture in a fresh way. Each chapter includes an icebreaker question to prompt you to connect your own experience with the topic at hand. At the end of each chapter, you&#x2019;ll also find questions in the &#x201c;Living and Loving with Abandon&#x201d; section geared toward helping you reflect on how the &#x201c;wild side&#x201d; of Jesus can impact your heart today. These questions are especially stimulating when discussed over coffee with friends! &nbsp;I believe you&#x2019;ll find <i>Untamed </i>to be an interesting book-club selection, an engaging Sunday school curriculum, or even a useful tool to help your women&#x2019;s Bible study group explore the life and ministry of Christ. I sincerely pray it&#x2019;ll help you experience some of the same freedom God has been lavishing on me lately.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of all I pray it quickens your heart to wonder and worship over the mind-blowing miracle that King Jesus chooses us as the objects of His affection!</p><h2>The New Pekinese</h2><p>Briefly traces the history of Pekingese, offers advice on their training, grooming, and care requirements, and discusses breed standards</p><p></p><h2>The Devil Finds Work: Essays</h2><p>James Baldwin At The Movies...&nbsp;&nbsp;Provocative, timeless, brilliant. <br><br>Bette Davis's eyes, Joan Crawford's bitchy elegance, Stepin Fetchit's stereotype, Sidney Poitier's superhuman black man...&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the movie stars and the qualities that influenced James Baldwin...&nbsp;&nbsp;and now become part of his incisive look at racism in American movies.<br><br>Baldwin challenges the underlying assumptions in such films as <i>In the Heat of the Night,</i> <i>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,</i> and <i>The Exorcist,</i> offering us a vision of America's self-delusions and deceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are our loves and hates, biases and cruelties, fears and ignorance reflected by the films that have entertained us and shaped our consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, too, is the stunning prose of a writer whose passion never diminished his struggle for equality, justice, and social change.<br><br>From <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> to <i>The Exorcist</i>--one of America's most important writers turns his critical eye to American film.</p><p><b>James Baldwin</b> (1924-1987) was educated in New York. His first novel, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, received excellent reviews and was immediately recognized as establishing a profound and permanent new voice in American letters. The appearance of <i>The Fire Next Time</i> in 1963, just as the civil rights movement was exploding across the American South, galvanized the nation and continues to reverberate as perhaps the most prophetic and defining statement ever written of the continuing costs of Americans' refusal to face their own history. It became a national bestseller, and Baldwin was featured on the cover of <i>Time</i>. The next year, he was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and collaborated with the photographer Richard Avedon on <i>Nothing Personal</i>, a series of portraits of America intended as a eulogy for the slain Medger Evers. His other collaborations include <i>A Rap on Race</i> with Margaret Mead and <i>A Dialogue</i> with the poet-activist Nikki Giovanni. He also adapted Alex Haley's <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> into <i>One Day When I Was Lost</i>. He was made a commander of the French Legion of Honor a year before his death, one honor among many he achieved in his life.<br><br><b>ONE<br>Congo Square<br><br></b>Joan Crawford's straight, narrow, and lonely back. We are following her through the corridors of a moving train. She is looking for someone, or is she is trying to escape from someone. She is eventually intercepted by, I think, Clark Gable.<br><br>I am fascinated by the movement on, and of, the screen, that movement which is something like the heaving and swelling of the sea (though I have not yet been to the sea): and which is also something like the light which moves on, and especially beneath, the water.<br><br>I am about seven. I am with my mother, or my aunt. The movie is <i>Dance, Fools, Dance</i>. <br><br>I don't remember the film. A child is far too self-centered to relate to any dilemma which does not, somehow, relate to him&#x2014; to his own evolving dilemma. The child escapes into what he would like his situation to be, and I certainly do not wish to be a fleeing fugitive on a moving train; and, also, with quite another part of my mind, I was aware that Joan Crawford was a white lady. Yet, I remember being sent to the store sometime later, and a colored woman, who, to me, looked exactly like Joan Crawford, was buying something. She was so incredibly beautiful&#x2014;she seemed to be wearing the sunlight, rearranging it around her from time to time, with a movement of one hand, with a movement of her head, and with her smile&#x2014;that, when she paid the man and started out of the store, I started out behind her. The storekeeper, who knew me, nd others in the store who knew my mother's little boy (and who also knew my Miss Crawford!) laughed and called me back. Miss Crawford also laughed and looked down at me with so beautiful a smile that I was not even embarrassed. Which was rare for me.<br><br><i>Tom Mix</i>, on his white horse. Actually, it was Tom Mix's hat, a shadow in the shadow of the hat, a kind of rock background (which, again, was always moving) and the white horse. Tom Mix was a serial. Every Saturday, then, if memory serves, we left Tom Mix and some bleakly interchangeable girl in the most dreadful danger&#x2014;or, rather, we left the hat and the shadow of the hat and the white horse: for the horse was not interchangeable and the serial could not have existed without it. <br><br><i>The Last of the Mohicans:</i> Randolph Scott (a kind of fifteenth-rate Gary Cooper) and Binnie Barnes (a kind of funky Geraldine Fitzgerald), Heather Angel (a somewhat more bewildered Olivia de Havilland) and Philip Reed (a precursor of Anthony Quinn). Phillip Reed was the Indian, Uncas, whose savage, not to say slavish adoration of Miss Angel's fine blonde frame drives her over a cliff, headlong, to her death. She has chosen death before dishonor, which made perfect sense. The erring Uncas eventually pays for his misguided lust with his life, and a tremulous, met-eyed brave couple, Randolph Scott and Binnie Barnes, eventually, hand in hand, manage to make it out of the wilderness. Into America, or back to England, I really do not remember, and I don't suppose that it matters.<br><br><i>20,000 Years in Sing Sing</i>: Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis. By this time, I had been taken in hand by a young white school-teacher, a beautiful woman, very important to me. I was between ten and eleven. She had directed my first play and endured my first theatrical tantrums and had then decided to escort me into the world. She gave me books to read and talked to me about the books, and about the world: about Spain, for example, and Ethiopia, and Italy, and the German Third Reich; and took me to see plays and films, plays and films to which no one else would have dreamed of taking a ten-year-old boy. I loved her, of course, and absolutely, with a child's love; didn't understand half of what she said, but remembered it; and it stood me in a good stead later. It is certainly partly because of her, who arrived in my terrifying life so soon, that I never really managed to hate white people&#x2014;though, God knows, I have often wished to murder more than one or two. But Bill Miller&#x2014;her name was Orilla, we called her Bill&#x2014;was not white for me in the way, for example, that Joan Crawford was white, in the way that the landlords and the store keepers and the cops and most of my teachers were white. She didn't baffle me that way and she never frightened me and she never lied to me. I never felt her pity, either, in spite of the fact that she sometimes brought us old clothes (because she worried about our winters) and cod-liver oil, especially for me, because I seemed destined, then, to be carried away by whooping cough.<br><br>I was a child, of course, and, therefore, unsophisticated. I don't seem ever to have had any innate need (or, indeed, any innate ability) to distrust people: and so I took Bill Miller as she was, or as she appeared to be to me. Yet, the difference between Miss Miller and other white people, white people as they lived in my imagination, and also as they were in life, had to have had a profound and bewildering effect on my mind. Bill Miller was not at all like the cops who had already beaten me up, she was not like the landlords who called me nigger, she was not like the storekeepers who laughed at me. I had found white people to be unutterably menacing, terrifying, mysterious&#x2014;wicked: and they were mysterious, in fact, to the extent that they were wicked: the unfathomable question being, precisely, this one: what, under heaven, or beneath the sea, or in the catacombs of hell, could cause any people to act as white people acted? From Miss Miller, therefore, I began to suspect that white people did not act as they did because they were white, but for some other reason, and I began to try to located and understand the reason. She, too, anyway, was treated like a nigger, especially by the cops, and she had no love for landlords.<br><br>My father said, during all the years I lived with him, that I was the ugliest boy he had ever seen, and I had absolutely no reason to doubt him. But it was not my father's hatred of <i>my </i>frog-eyes which hurt me, this hatred proving, in time, to be rather more resounding than real: I have my mother's eyes. When my father called me ugly, he was not attacking me so much as he was attacking my mother. (No doubt, he was also attacking my real, and unknown, father.) And I loved my mother. I knew that she loved me, and I sensed that she was paying an enormous price for me. I was a boy, and so I didn't really too much care that my father thought me hideous. (So I said to myself&#x2014;this judgment, nevertheless, was to have a decidedly terrifying effect on my life.) But I thought that he must have been stricken blind (or was as mysteriously wicked as white people, a paralyzing thought) if he was unable to see that my mother was absolutely beyond any question the most beautiful woman in the world. <br><br>So, here, now, was Bette Davis, on that Saturday afternoon, in close-up, over a champagne glass, pop-eyes popping. I was astounded. I had caught my father, not in a lie, but in an infirmity. For, here, before me, after all, was a <i>movie star: white: </i>and if she was white and a movie star, she was <i>rich</i>: and she was <i>ugly.</i> I felt exactly the same way I felt, just before this moment, of just after, when I was in the street, playing, and I saw an old, very black, and very drunk woman stumbling up the sidewalk, and I ran upstairs to make my mother come to the window and see what I had found: <i>You see?&nbsp; You see? She's uglier than you, Mama! She's uglier than me!</i> Out of bewilderment, out of loyalty to my mother, probably, and also because I sensed something menacing and unhealthy (for me, certainly) in the face on the screen, I gave Davis's skin the dead-white greenish cast of something crawling form under a rock, but I was held, just the same, by the tense intelligence of the forehead, the disaster of the lips: and when she moved, she moved just like a nigger. Eventually, from a hospital bed, she murders someone, and Tracy takes the weight, to Sing Sing. In his arms, Davis cries and cries, and the movie ends. "What's going to happen to her now?" I asked Bill Miller. "We don't know," said Bill, conveying to me, nevertheless, that she would probably never get over it, that people pay for what they do.<br><br>I had not yet heard Bessie Smith's "<i>why they call this place the Sing Sing?/come stand here by this rock pile, and listen to these hammers ring</i>," and it would be seven years before I would begin working on the railroad. It was to take a longer time than that before I would cry; a longer time than that before I would cry in anyone's arms; and a long long long long time before I would begin to realize what I myself was doing with my enormous eyes&#x2014;or vice versa. This had nothing to do with Davis, the actress, or with all those hang-ups I didn't yet know I had: I had discovered that my infirmity might not be my doom; my infirmity, or infirmities, might be forged into weapons.<br><br>For I was not only considered by my father to be ugly. I was considered by everyone to be "strange," including my poor mother, who didn't, however, beat me for it. well, if I was "strange" &#x2014;and I knew I must be, otherwise people would not have treated me so strangely, and I would not have been so miserable&#x2014;perhaps I could find a way to use my strangeness. A "strange" child, anyway, dimly and fearfully apprehends that the years are not likely to make him less strange. Therefore, if he wishes to live, he must calculate, and I knew that I had to live. I very much wanted my mother to be happy and to be proud of me, and I very much loved my brothers and my sisters, who, in a sense, were all I had. My father showed no favoritism, he did not beat me worse than the others because I was not his son. (I didn't know this then, anyway, none of the children did, and by the time we all found out, it became just one more detail of the peculiar journey we had made in company with each other.) I knew, too, that my mother depended on me. I was not always dependable, for no child can be, but I tried: and I knew that I might have to prepare myself to be, one day, the actu...</p><h2>This Thing Called You</h2><p>The inspiration of Ernest Holmes has reached hundreds of thousands of readers through his classic works, many of which are just now becoming available in paperback.

The novel, known primarily for its erotic realism, is also a landmark in the development of the narrative art form&#x2015;not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but in a world-historical context.</p><p>This complete and annotated translation aims to faithfully represent and elucidate all the rhetorical features of the original in its most authentic form and thereby enable the Western reader to appreciate this Chinese masterpiece at its true worth.</p></p><p><b>David Tod Roy</b> (1933&#x2013;2016) was professor emeritus of Chinese literature at the University of Chicago. His monumental five-volume translation of the <i>Chin P'ing Mei</i> was completed in 2013."Both the fourth volume of <i>The Plum</i> and the previous three volumes are top-notch English translation of traditional Chinese fiction. Roy's superb translation skills preserve the subtleties in the original Chinese novel. English-speaking readers can, for the first time, appreciate one of the masterpieces of Chinese fiction in its entirety, thanks to Roy's diligent and careful work. Most important of all, <i>The Plum</i> represents the culmination of Roy's life-long devotion to research on fin Ping Mei and demonstrates Roy's encyclopedic knowledge of Jin Ping Mei scholarship. Reading <i>The Plum</i> can help scholars understand the research that has been conducted on this novel and help them develop new directions for future research. I wholeheartedly recommend <i>The Plum</i> to anyone interested in Chinese literature, culture, and history, and look forward to the publication of the final volume of Roy's translation."<b>---Junjie Luo, <i>Chinese Literature</i></b><br><br>"This volume, a masterwork of translation of language, culture, social values, and literary intent provides students of linguistics, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, and history, as well as those willing to invest time in a long but highly entertaining tale with an invaluable opportunity to gain insight into sixteenth-century society outside imperial court circles during the Ming era."<b>---Ilicia J. Sprey, <i>Sixteenth Century Journal</i></b><br><br>"Reading Roy's translation is a remarkable experience."<b>---Robert Chatain, <i>Chicago Tribune Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"Clearly David Roy is the greatest scholar-translator in the field of premodern vernacular Chinese fiction. . . . The puns and various other kinds of word plays that abound in the <i>Chin P'ing Mei</i> are so difficult to translate that I can't help 'slapping the table in amazement' each time I see evidence of Roy's masterful rendition of them. . . . I recommend this book, in the strongest possible terms, to anyone interested in the novel form in general, in Chinese literature in particular, or in the translation of Chinese literature."<b>---Shuhui Yang, <i>Chinese Literature</i></b><br><br>"[A] book of manners for the debauched. Its readers in the late Ming period likely hid it under their bedcovers."<b>---Amy Tan, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"[I]t is time to remind ourselves that <i>The Plum in the Golden Vase</i> is not just about sex, whether the numerous descriptions of sexual acts throughout the novel be viewed as titillating, harshly realistic, or, in Mr. Roy's words, intended 'to express in the most powerful metaphor available to him the author's contempt for the sort of persons who indulge in them.' The novel is a sprawling panorama of life and times in urban China, allegedly set safely in the Sung dynasty, but transparently contemporary to the author's late sixteenth-century world, as scores of internal references demonstrate. The eight hundred or so men, women, and children who appear in the book cover a breath-taking variety of human types, and encompass pretty much every imaginable mood and genre&#x2015;from sadism to tenderness, from light humor to philosophical musings, from acute social commentary to outrageous satire."<b>---Jonathan Spence, <i>New York Review of Books</i></b></p><h2>An Introduction to Literary Chinese (Harvard East Asian Monographs)</h2><p>This textbook for beginning students contains 35 lessons of increasing difficulty designed to introduce students to the basic patterns of Classical Chinese and to provide practice in reading a variety of texts.

The text abounds in fine color and black-and-white illustrations and includes brief artist biographies and translations of 20th-century avant-garde manifestos.

These systems create long-term data &#x201c;warehouses&#x201d; that can be easily accessed to return and analyze results, such as, &#x201c;Show me all of the clients from Canada that have purchased more than $20,000 in the last 3 years.&#x201d; This &#x201c;query,&#x201d; which would have taken an extensive amount of hands-on research to complete prior to the use of database, can now be determined in seconds by executing a simple SELECT SQL statement on a database.<br><br> SQL can seem daunting to those with little to zero programming knowledge and can even pose a challenge to those that have experience with other languages.

A brooding Yorkshire tale of a love that is stronger than death, it is also a fierce vision of metaphysical passion, in which heaven and hell, nature and society, are powerfully juxtaposed. Unique, mystical, with a timeless appeal, it has become a classic of English literature.</p><h2>Diabetic Living Eat to Beat Diabetes: Stop Type 2 Diabetes and Prediabetes: 175 Healthy Recipes to Change Your Life</h2><p><b>An achievable plan for beating type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, with more than 100 photos and complete nutrition information.</b><br><br> So much more than a cookbook, <i>Eat to Beat Diabetes</i> is a lifestyle guide for losing weight, balancing blood sugar, and controlling diabetes for good.

Anyone working in the payments industry - or needing to use payments products - can benefit from understanding this. The second edition updates information on card, ACH, and check systems, as well as providing perspective on developments in emerging payments.</p><p>At Glenbrook, we often refer to ourselves as "payments geeks". &nbsp;In our strategy consulting practice, in our teaching, and in our writings we like to delve down into the details of how the systems work - and we like to share it with others! &nbsp;I've found a particular fascination in the economics of the payments industry - discovering where money is made, and how.Carol Benson<b>The Payments Systems Explained!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Are you a payments professional who wants to understand more about the systems you work with every day?

Traditional views of rationality tend to see decision makers as possessing superhuman powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and all of eternity in which to ponder choices. To understand decisions in the real world, we need a different, more psychologically plausible notion of rationality, and this book provides it. It is about fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules for making decisions when time is pressing and deep thought an unaffordable luxury. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices, classifications, and predictions by employing bounded rationality. <br> But when and how can such fast and frugal heuristics work? Can judgments based simply on one good reason be as accurate as those based on many reasons? Could less knowledge even lead to systematically better predictions than more knowledge? <em>Simple Heuristics</em> explores these questions, developing computational models of heuristics and testing them through experiments and analyses. It shows how fast and frugal heuristics can produce adaptive decisions in situations as varied as choosing a mate, dividing resources among offspring, predicting high school drop out rates, and playing the stock market. <br> As an interdisciplinary work that is both useful and engaging, this book will appeal to a wide audience. It is ideal for researchers in cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, and cognitive science, as well as in economics and artificial intelligence. It will also inspire anyone interested in simply making good decisions.<br></p><p>How can anyone be rational in a world where knowledge is limited, time is pressing, and deep thought is often an unattainable luxury? In our book, "Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart," we invite readers to embark on a new journey into a land of rationality that differs from the familiar territory of cognitive science and economics. Traditional models of rationality in these fields have tended to view decision-makers as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and an eternity in which to make choices. But to understand decisions in the real world, we need a different, more psychologically plausible notion of rationality. This book provides such a view. It is about fast and frugal heuristics-simple rules for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices, judgments, and predictions by employing bounded rationality. <p>But when and how can such fast and frugal heuristics work? What heuristics are in the mind's "adaptive toolbox," and what building blocks compose them? Can judgments based simply on a single reason be as accurate as those based on many reasons? Could having less knowledge even lead to systematically better predictions than having more knowledge? We explore these questions by developing computational models of heuristics and testing them through theoretical analysis and practical experiments with people. We show how fast and frugal heuristics can yield adaptive decisions in situations as varied as choosing a mate, dividing resources among offspring, predicting high-school drop-out rates, and profiting from the stock market. </p><p>We have worked to create an interdisciplinary book that is both useful and engaging and will appeal to a wide audience. It is intended for readers interested in cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, and cognitive science, as well as in economics and artificial intelligence. We hope that it will also inspire anyone who simply wants to make good decisions.</p>"How do people cope in the real, complex world of confusing and overwhelming information and rapidly approaching deadlines? This important book starts a new quest for answers. Here, Gigerenzer, Todd, and their lively research group show that simple heuristics are powerful tools that do surprisingly well. The field of decision making will never be the same again." --Donald A. Norman, Nielsen Norman Group, Professor Emeritus, University of California, San Diego, and author of "Things that Make Us Smart" and "The Invisible Computer" <p>"In the past few years, the theory of rational ("sensible") human behavior has broken loose from the illusory and empirically unsupported notion that deciding rationally means maximizing expected utility. Research has learned to take seriously and study empirically how real human beings ... actually address the vast complexities of the world they inhabit. Simple Heuristics ... offers a fascinating introduction to this revolution in cognitive science, striking a great blow for sanity in the approach to human rationality." --Herbert A. Simon, Nobel Laureate in Economics and Professor of Computer Science and Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University </p><p>"This book is a major contribution to the theory of bounded rationality. It illustrates that the surprising efficiency of fast and simple procedures is due to their fit with the structure of the environment in which they are used.

They are encouraged to look at oceanography as a cohesive and united discipline rather than a collection of subjects gathered under a marine umbrella. This first edition teaches students about the historical, geological, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the ocean environment using remarkable images and photos. The authors have incorporated essays written by several scientists discussing topics in their fields of specialization. And in order to understand the constant barrage of information concerning our planet and marine issues, the authors believe students must have a basic command of the language of marine science in addition to understanding processes and principles. By the end of this course, the authors want students to be prepared for future environmental discussions and the ability to make decisions as informed global citizens.</p><p>Keith Sverdrup is a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.</p><h2>AMERICAN LITERATURE STUDENT WORKBOOK</h2><p><p>Access to a broad range of literature</p> <p>This textbook captures over 400 years of America's literary history.

What was the Golden Calf? Why are mirrors believed to carry bad luck? How could anyone think that mortals like Perseus, Beowulf, and St. George actually fought dragons, since dragons don't exist? Strange though they sound, however, these "myths" did not begin as fiction.</p><br><p> This absorbing book shows that myths originally transmitted real information about real events and observations, preserving the information sometimes for millennia within nonliterate societies. Geologists' interpretations of how a volcanic cataclysm long ago created Oregon's Crater Lake, for example, is echoed point for point in the local myth of its origin. The Klamath tribe saw it happen and passed down the story--for nearly 8,000 years.</p><br><p> We, however, have been literate so long that we've forgotten how myths encode reality. Recent studies of how our brains work, applied to a wide range of data from the Pacific Northwest to ancient Egypt to modern stories reported in newspapers, have helped the Barbers deduce the characteristic principles by which such tales both develop and degrade through time. Myth is in fact a quite reasonable way to convey important messages orally over many generations--although reasoning back to the original events is possible only under rather specific conditions.</p><br><p> Our oldest written records date to 5,200 years ago, but we have been speaking and mythmaking for perhaps 100,000.

In a follow-up to <i>The Predicament of Culture</i>, one of the defining books for anthropology in the last decade, James Clifford takes the proper measure: a moving picture of a world that doesn't stand still, that reveals itself en route, in the airport lounge and the parking lot as much as in the marketplace and the museum.</p><p>In this collage of essays, meditations, poems, and travel reports, Clifford takes travel and its difficult companion, translation, as openings into a complex modernity. He contemplates a world ever more connected yet not homogeneous, a global history proceeding from the fraught legacies of exploration, colonization, capitalist expansion, immigration, labor mobility, and tourism. Ranging from Highland New Guinea to northern California, from Vancouver to London, he probes current approaches to the interpretation and display of non-Western arts and cultures. Wherever people and things cross paths and where institutional forces work to discipline unruly encounters, Clifford's concern is with struggles to displace stereotypes, to recognize divergent histories, to sustain "postcolonial" and "tribal" identities in contexts of domination and globalization.</p><p>Travel, diaspora, border crossing, self-location, the making of homes away from home: these are transcultural predicaments for the late twentieth century. The map that might account for them, the history of an entangled modernity, emerges here as an unfinished series of paths and negotiations, leading in many directions while returning again and again to the struggles and arts of cultural encounter, the impossible, inescapable tasks of translation.</p></p><p>Early on in <i>Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century</i>, James Clifford describes his new approach to studying cultures: "Where professional anthropology has erected a border, I portray a borderland, a zone of contacts--blocked and permitted, policed and transgressive." In the not-too-distant past, anthropologists traveled to remote areas and observed cultures that they assumed were not influenced much by the outside world. Clifford points out that since there is no such thing as an isolated culture today, the tools and assumptions of anthropology must change to suit the hybrid and fluid cultures that currently populate the world. In this book, Clifford examines a series of places where culture is in transition--places he calls "borderlands." He visits a few art museums, some Mayan ruins, and the New York subway. Everywhere he goes, he finds cultures colliding and changing. That's not terribly surprising, but his interpretation of these otherwise banal places is thought-provoking.<p> This book is a grab bag: a collection of academic lectures, travel-journal entries, meditations on history, and impressionistic recollections. In the chapter entitled "White Ethnicity," Clifford interweaves his memories of a subway ride across New York City several decades ago with paragraphs from an Audre Lourde essay on identity politics and paragraphs from John Wesley Powell's account of his exploration of the Colorado River. In less capable hands, this format could be quite muddled and confusing, but Clifford pulls it off nicely. Clifford uses these three "travel" narratives to explore the major concerns of this collection. <i>Routes</i> is an accessible, innovative guide to one of the major issues anthropologists are grappling with today. <i>--Jill Marquis</i></p>James Clifford is Professor Emeritus in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><h2>Castle Skull: A Locked-Room Mystery (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p><strong>That is the case.

Most remarkably, <i>The Origin of Species</i> said very little about, of all things, the origins of species. Darwin and his modern successors have shown very convincingly how inherited variations are naturally selected, but they leave unanswered how variant organisms come to be in the first place.In <i>Symbiotic Planet,</i> renowned scientist Lynn Margulis shows that symbiosis, which simply means members of different species living in physical contact with each other, is crucial to the origins of evolutionary novelty. Ranging from bacteria, the smallest kinds of life, to the largest the living Earth itself Margulis explains the symbiotic origins of many of evolution's most important innovations. The very cells we're made of started as symbiotic unions of different kinds of bacteria. Sex and its inevitable corollary, death arose when failed attempts at cannibalism resulted in seasonally repeated mergers of some of our tiniest ancestors. Dry land became forested only after symbioses of algae and fungi evolved into plants. Since all living things are bathed by the same waters and atmosphere, all the inhabitants of Earth belong to a symbiotic union. Gaia, the finely tuned largest ecosystem of the Earth's surface, is just symbiosis as seen from space. Along the way, Margulis describes her initiation into the world of science and the early steps in the present revolution in evolutionary biology; the importance of species classification for how we think about the living world; and the way academic apartheid&#x201d; can block scientific advancement. Written with enthusiasm and authority, this is a book that could change the way you view our living Earth.</p><p><b>Lynn Margulis,</b> Distinguished Professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1983. She is best known for her pathbreaking work on the bacterial origins of cell organelles and for her collaboration with James Lovelock on Gaia theory. Her previous books include <i>Symbiosis in Cell Evolution; Five Kingdoms</i> (with K. V. Schwartz); and (with Dorion Sagan) <i>Origins of Sex, Garden of Microbial Delights, What Is Life?, What Is Sex?, </i>and<i> Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution.</i>Let's hear it for the bugs not your creepy-crawlies, but bacteria, the be-all (and possible end-all) of life on Earth, according to Margulis. Here she describes the once radical theory that cells have incorporated bacteria to mutual advantage and uses that as a springboard to summarize a still more radical theory of how species evolve. She calls it serial endosymbiosis theory (SET). It is now conventional wisdom that the energy-producing mitochondria in animal cells were once free-living bacteria. Indeed, they have their own genesdifferent from nuclear DNA. Margulis provides many examples of fruitful symbioses, including sexual union itself as the merger of sperm and egg cells. According to SET, there are successive steps or mergers that led to multicellular life forms: In steps one and two the oldest bacterial formsthe non-oxygen breathing ``archaebacteria'' found in deep ocean ventsmerged with swimming bacteria two billion years ago to form the nuclear heart of animal, plant, and fungal cells and provide the cilia for swimming. Later steps introduced a third partner able to breathe oxygen and added the ability to engulf and digest food (phagocytosis). The last step involved engulfing yet another bacteriumbut one these various new forms of life could not digest: bright green photosynthetic bacteria. The bone of contention here is the origin of ciliated cellscritical to evolution for their vital role as sperm tails, among other things. Margulis has a theory about their origin, but as they say, more research is needed. Margulis's theory also dictates a change in taxonomy to five kingdoms: bacteria at the base, then ``protoctists'' (algae, slime molds, ciliates) next, and then animals, plants, and fungi. Finally, she defends Lovelock's Gaia theory, which she interprets to mean that enormous interacting ecosystems on Earth achieve homeostasis rather than that the planet is in the hands of some benign Mother Earth. This is vintage Margulispersonal, autobiographical, passionate, argumentative, at times over the top, but full of ideasat least some of which, in the past, have proved to be right. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Out of a wounding sense of alienation and dividedness he created a profoundly original symbolic language, in which words and images unite in a unique interpretation of self and society. He was a counterculture prophet whose art still challenges us to think afresh about almost every aspect of experience&#x2014;social, political, philosophical, religious, erotic, and aesthetic. He believed that we live in the midst of Eternity here and now, and that if we could open our consciousness to the fullness of being, it would be like experiencing a sunrise that never ends.<br> &nbsp;<br> Following Blake&#x2019;s life from beginning to end, acclaimed biographer Leo Damrosch draws extensively on Blake&#x2019;s poems, his paintings, and his etchings and engravings to offer this generously illustrated account of Blake the man and his vision of our world. The author&#x2019;s goal is to inspire the reader with the passion he has for his subject, achieving the imaginative response that Blake himself sought to excite. The book is an invitation to understanding and enjoyment, an invitation to appreciate Blake&#x2019;s imaginative world and, in so doing, to open the doors of our perception.</p><p>Praise for Leo Damrosch&#x2019;s <i>Jonathan Swift: His Life and World</i><br><br> &#x201c;This will be the definitive life of Swift for years to come.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jonathan Bate, <i>New Statesman</i><br><br> &#x201c;Superb. . . .

The emphasis is on material applicable to field studies of evolution focusing on ecologically important traits. Topics addressed are critical for training students in ecology, evolution, conservation biology, agriculture, forestry, and wildlife management.<br><br>Many texts in this field are too complex and mathematical to allow the average beginning student to readily grasp the key concepts. <em>A Primer of Ecological Genetics</em>, in contrast, employs mathematics and statistics--fully explained, but at a less advanced level--as tools to improve understanding of biological principles. The main goal is to enable students to understand the concepts well enough that they can gain entry into the primary literature. Integration of the different chapters of the book shows students how diverse concepts relate to each other.<br><strong>For Students</strong><br><br>Solutions to Problems<br><br>Solutions to all of the problems in the textbook, worked out in full, are available. (See the Solutions to Problems button at right.)<br><strong>For Instructors</strong> (Available to qualified adopters)<br><br>The <strong>Instructor's Resource Library</strong> features all of the textbook's figures, tables, and equations, provided in ready-to-use PowerPoint presentations. All of the images have been formatted and optimized for excellent projection quality.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrey K. Conner</strong> is Professor, Kellogg Biological Station and Department of Plant Biology, at Michigan State University. He earned his B.A. (Biology) at Harvard University and his Ph.D. (with Thomas Eisner, in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior) at Cornell University. His postdoctoral work with Sara Via, also at Cornell, focused on evolutionary quantitative genetics. Dr. Conner's research integrates evolution, genetics, and ecology. He has taught courses in introductory biology, behavioral ecology, population biology, ecological genetics, evolutionary biology, and field ecology and evolution.<br><br><strong>Daniel L. Hartl</strong> is Higgins Professor of Biology in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, with James F. Crow, then did postdoctoral study at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of <em>Principles of Population Genetics</em>, Third Edition, with Andrew G. Clark; <em>A Primer of Population Genetics</em>, Third Edition; and <em>A Primer of Ecological Genetics,</em> and other leading textbooks on genetics. His current areas of interest include molecular evolution, evolutionary genomics, and population genetics.<br><br>"Until now, a textbook aimed at undergraduates and early postgraduates, which integrates both population and quantitative genetics, has been lacking. In six chapters, Conner and Hartl have successfully filled this gap. The well-planned structure, easy reading style and extensive coverage make this book valuable not only to undergraduate students but also for population and quantitative geneticists aiming to expand their scope of their own research."--JM Cano Arias, <em>Heredity</em><p></p><br>"I find that this volume will be very useful for both inspired undergraduates who plan on initiating honors studies or independent research, and for beginning graduate students. This primer will help young biologists learn the nuts and bolts of ecological genetics, as well as its practical applications."--Jeffry B. Mitton, <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"In sum, <em>A Primer of Ecological Genetics</em> provides a lucid introduction to foundational principles in the field. In their preface, Conner and Hartl state, 'The guiding principle of the book is to focus on clear explanations of the key concepts in the evolution of natural and managed populations.' The first edition of <em>A Primer of Ecological Genetics</em> accomplishes this nicely. I recommend it with enthusiasm."--Mark C. Ungerer, <em>BioScience</em><p></p><br>"The new <em>Primer of Ecological Genetics</em> is absolutely terrific. The book is bound to go a long way in clearing up fuzzy thinking about basic concepts at the interface of evolution and ecology. Just as importantly, it will engender much better experimental design--and much clearer discussion of results--in future dissertations and the papers that follow from them."--John N.

In the process she develops a pedagogy that encompasses wholeness, multiculturalism, and contemplative practice, that helps students transcend limiting views about themselves; fosters high expectations, and helps students to become social change agents. <br><br>She invites the reader to share her journey in developing sentipensante pedagogy, and to challenge seven entrenched agreements about education that act against wholeness and the appreciation of truth in all forms. She offers examples of her own teaching and of the classroom practices of faculty she encountered along the way; as well as guidance on the challenges, rewards and responsibilities that anyone embarking on creating a new vision of teaching and learning should attend to.</p><p>Laura I. Rend�n is Professor of Higher Education at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She is also a consultant and speaker on topics related to contemplative pedagogy and its applications in multicultural and social justice educational settings, and is nationally known for her work related to college access, retention, and graduation of low-income, first-generation students.For service-learning practitioners and scholars, Sentipensante (Sensing/Thinking) Pedagogy is one of those rare books that subtly but fundamentally alters the purpose and scope of our work. It is a book about the future of our community-based teaching, learning, and scholarship and the future of higher education. It is a future that is already upon us but one to which higher education has not effectively responded nor embraced. This is a book that recognizes that non-Western, non-traditional, highly diverse students and faculty increasingly are in highereducation but not of higher education. Their ways of knowing and habits of being are not validated by the structures and cultures of the academy. Fundamental change is needed Read this book. Read it now. Savor it and teasure it. If you are an educator who cares about the deeper public purposes of higher education; who cares about improving teaching and learning for an increasingly diverse student body; who cares about education as transformative, holistic, integrative, civic learning; who cares about the tenure-seeking woman of color as she enacts her faculty roles connected to social concerns and new ways of generating knowledge; who cares about changing the culture of higher education so it is better able to fulfill its academic and civic missions; and who cares about whether higher education two or three decades from now will be contributing meaningfully to solving social problems and building a more vibrant democracy then read this book and put its wisdom into practice in your own work and lives as educators Rendon s book, is the Pedagogy of the Oppressed for our time, bringing the lenses of feminist, postmodernist, anticolonial, and critical theory to bear on liberatory education. &#34;&#34;Sentipensante Pedagogy&#34; provides a helpful invitation and charitable contribution to the ongoing dialogue between different visions of pedagogy.&#34; &#34;Challenging, inspiring, beautifully written, and unusual, this book calls readers to find ways to link mind and heart -- thinking and feeling -- to transform teaching and learning in higher education. I commend this book to readers. Laura Rendon has illustrated how one can unite one&#39;s deep beliefs, values, and feelings, with one&#39;s keen analytical and intellectual abilities.Many faculty members, and certainly many graduate students considering work in academe, are interested in how to shape careers where their passions and values are central, and how to find satisfactory and meaningful balance in their commitment to both the professional and personal dimensions of their lives.Laura Rendon&#39;s volume offers insights, examples, questions and inspiration that will help those grappling with such issues. The book or any of its individual chapters can be used by individuals thinking through their own values and practice, in classes designed to prepare future faculty members, or in faculty development programs organizing dialogues about teaching and academic life...an important, thought-provoking, and unique addition to the literature on teaching, learning, and the academic life.&#34; &#34;Rendon assists the transformation of teaching and learning in higher education into a balance, a harmony, between two concepts such as intellectualism and intuition, teaching and learning, the learner and the learned material, and Western and non-Western ways of knowing. She explores the need for a new dream of education, the experience of creating an integrative and consonant pedagogy, and the experience of using such a pedagogy rooted in social justice. Among specific discussions are learning from another&#39;s story, refashioning the dream, the courage to chart a different path, and sustaining the soul that embraces a different truth.&#34; &#34;This masterpiece...is about inclusion, one in which faculty and students become one in recognizing and accepting their responsibility [for] social justice and liberation. All who [teach] must read this book. It should be considered required marerial in diversity, social sciences and education courses. If I must select a word to describe this book, it would be &#34; Magnifico! &#34; Teaching the whole student begins in clarity of language, but to even glimpse the possibility of stepping beyond knowledge (facts, figures, theories) toward the cultivation of wisdom, it must honor means of communicating that lie beyond language and do so with the same commitment to clarity that is to say, honesty that Nida s essay calls for. Rendon s pedagogical model takes a courageous step in that direction; hence, the amount of attention given to it in this issue. &#34;What would happen if educators eschewed the silent agreements that govern institutions and established a new set of working assumptions that honor the fullness of humanity? In this visionary study, Laura Rendon lays the groundwork for a pedagogy that bridges the gap between mind and heart to lead students and educators toward a new conception of teaching and learning. Grounding her work in interviews of scholars who are already transforming the educational landscape, Rendon invites the reader to join a burgeoning movement toward more inclusive classrooms that honor each learner&#39;s identity and support education for social justice. Her book is vital reading for anyone seeking to create more inclusive institutions for students and teachers alike.&#34; Laura Rendon has done a beautiful thing. She has mindfully, thoughtfully and with great clarity seen and named our familiar habits of thought, belief and practice that limit the dynamic evolution of how we lift up, honor, and educate the precious hearts, minds and bodies of our children.Laura has sifted these complex threads through the lens of her fine mind and good heart, offering us a clear and colorful tapestry of guidance and companionship on a fresh, imperative educational adventure.We cannot ever honestly claim to nourish a new generation of souls unless we ourselves are actively and vitally alive and well. Through beginner s mind, a contagious sense of wonder, and a deeply courageous vision for what is possible, she offers us the ultimate gift of education: The unlimited capacity to grow a world of human beings deeper, stronger, wiser, and more loving. Rendon has written a pedagogic masterpiece with immense potential to transform teaching and learning in the K-12 system. Her pedagogy gives voice to what teachers have been yearning for in their hearts and minds. In this highly inspiring book, Laura Rendon offers a road map of what is possible if we are willing to embrace a vision of education that balances the inner life and ways of knowing and thinking with the outer life of just action and compassionate service to the world. She challenges us to embrace a pedagogy of wholeness that has the potential of totally transforming our schools and academies by reclaiming them as soulful places of relationship-centered learning and teaching rooted in social justice and equity. Through her moving and authentic examples of herself and others, Rendon creates promise, hope and inspiration by giving us the framework and tools to make this vision of education a reality. Reading this book is like taking a drink of cool, clear, fresh water both refreshing and invigorating. Professor Rendon calls us to examine how higher education is and has been, and to envision how it is becoming and can be. A pedagogy that embraces wholeness, social justice, and liberation will prepare students to create and sustain a world in which social equity and justice, economic sufficiency, and a healthy planet the triple bottom line in sustainable community building can be achieved. And if we are to foster student success, the journey toward wholeness and authenticity must begin with we who teach, learn, lead, and serve in higher education. Anyone who has yearned for a fresh vision of teaching and learning for the 21st century should read &#34;Sentipesante&#34;. Laura Rendon has written a book that is both deeply personal and prophetic. She balances scholarly familiarity with educational theory and history with the demographic reality that is already upon us: the changing composition of our classrooms on all measures of diversity. This is the future, and much of the power of &#34;Sentipesante&#34; derives from the fact that the experience of all Rendon s interviewees is in a range of public institutions. Written as a manifesto to her fellow faculty and kindred administrative spirits, Laura recognizes that not all will be up for the personal and professional challenge that this remaking of the academy entails. For those who are, it offers practical advice, courage, and inspiration. Like all work at the intersection of diversity and contemplative practice, this is a book that will change lives.</p><h2>Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis (Springer Series in Statistics)</h2><p>In this new edition the author has added substantial material on Bayesian analysis, including lengthy new sections on such important topics as empirical and hierarchical Bayes analysis, Bayesian calculation, Bayesian communication, and group decision making.

These challenges include: explicitly broadening the purposes for teaching high school mathematics beyond a focus on college and career readiness; dismantling structural obstacles that stand in the way of mathematics working for each and every student; implementing equitable instructional practices; identifying Essential Concepts that all high school students should learn and understand at a deep level; and organizing the high school curriculum around these Essential Concepts in order to support students future personal and professional goals. Catalyzing Change addresses the fact that significant numbers of high school students develop unproductive mathematical identities and see little value in mathematics, while the need for mathematical skills is increasing to meet the workplace, postsecondary education requirements, and to ensure active participation in our democratic society.</p><p></p><h2>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</h2><p><br> <p>This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i>. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.</p><br></p><p>John von Neumann (1903-1957) was one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century and a pioneering figure in computer science. A native of Hungary who held professorships in Germany, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in 1933. Later he worked on the Manhattan Project, helped develop the IAS computer, and was a consultant to IBM. An important influence on many fields of mathematics, he is the author of &#34;Functional Operators, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&#34;, and &#34;Continuous Geometry&#34; (all Princeton). Oskar Morgenstern (1902-1977) taught at the University of Vienna and directed the Austrian Institute of Business Cycle Research before settling in the United States in 1938. There he joined the faculty of Princeton University, eventually becoming a professor and from 1948 directing its econometric research program. He advised the United States government on a wide variety of subjects. Though most famous for the book he co-authored with von Neumann, Morgenstern was also widely known for his skepticism about economic measurement, as reflected in one of his many other books, &#34;On the Accuracy of Economic Observations&#34; (Princeton). Harold Kuhn is Professor Emeritus of Mathematical Economics at Princeton University. Ariel Rubinstein is Professor of Economics at Tel Aviv University and at New York University."Posterity may regard this book as one of the major scientific achievements of the first half of the twentieth century. This will undoubtedly be the case if the authors have succeeded in establishing a new exact science--the science of economics. The foundation which they have laid is extremely promising."<b>--<i>The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i></b><br><br>"One cannot but admire the audacity of vision, the perseverance in details, and the depth of thought displayed in almost every page of the book. . . . The appearance of a book of [this] calibre . . . is indeed a rare event."<b>--<i>The American Economic Review</i></b><br><br>"The main achievement of the book lies, more than in its concrete results, in its having introduced into economics the tools of modern logic and in using them with an astounding power of generalization."<b>--<i>The Journal of Political Economy</i></b></p><h2>John Milton: Life, Work, and Thought</h2><p>Written by two of the world's leading Milton scholars, widely praised as "illuminating" (<em>Times Literary Supplement</em>), "seamlessly written (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>), and "a book of permanent value" (<em>Literary Review</em>), and winner of the Milton Society's James Holly Hanford Award, this magnificent biography sheds fresh new light on the writings, the thought, and the life of poet John Milton. A more human Milton appears in these pages, a Milton who is flawed, self-contradictory, self-serving, arrogant, passionate, ruthless, ambitious, and cunning. He is also among the most accomplished writers of the period, the most eloquent polemicist of the mid-century, and the author of the finest and most influential narrative poem in English, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, which the book examines in detail. What Milton achieved in the face of crippling adversity, blindness, bereavement, and political eclipse, remains wondrous. Here is a fascinating biography of this towering literary figure--the first new serious study in forty years--one that profoundly challenges the received wisdom about one of England's leading poets and thinkers.</p><p><br><strong>Gordon Campbell</strong> is Professor of Renaissance Studies at University of Leicester.

Corns </strong>is Professor of English at Bangor University. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a Fellow of the English Association. He has published six books on Milton and other books on seventeenth-century literature.<br>There is renewed interest in Milton, particularly his political life, this year, the 400th anniversary of his birth. This substantial biography, seamlessly written by the editors of the <i>Oxford Milton,</i> draws chiefly on documentary evidence and an easy familiarity with the 17th-century English scene. As a prodigy scholar, pamphleteer, government translator on the international stage and the blind (probably from glaucoma) bard of the Bible, Milton found himself astride a world of hardening views, as it spiraled in political and spiritual transition. He wrote on divorce, freedom of expression and the tenure of kings; his <i>De Doctrina Christiana,</i> not unearthed until the 1820s, is an essential work of systematic theology. The authors set Milton's imaginative life against this backdrop, stretching from Shakespeare, to whom Milton's father may have been loosely connected, to Dryden's ingenious staging of <i>Paradise Lost</i> in couplets. With nearly 100 pages of notes and bibliography, this is a no-nonsense contribution to our understanding of a genius who, in many ways, is hardly remote from our times. 25 b&amp;w illus., maps. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They were among the first families of Virginia. Two were signers of the Declaration of Independence and several others distinguished themselves during the Revolutionary War. And one, Robert E. Lee, remains widely admired for his lofty character and military success.<br> In <em>The Lees of Virginia</em>, Paul Nagel chronicles seven generations of Lees, from the family founder Richard to General Robert E. Lee, covering over two hundred years of American history. We meet Thomas Lee, who dreamed of America as a continental empire. His daughter was Hannah Lee Corbin, a non-conformist in lifestyle and religion, while his son, Richard Henry Lee, was a tempestuous figure who wore black silk over a disfigured hand when he made the motion in Congress for Independence. Another of Thomas' sons, Arthur Lee, created a political storm by his accusations against Benjamin Franklin. Arthur's cousin was Light-Horse Harry Lee, a controversial cavalry officer in the Revolutionary War, whose wild real estate speculation led to imprisonment for debt and finally self-exile in the Caribbean. One of Harry's sons, Henry Lee, further disgraced the family by seducing his sister-in-law and frittering away Stratford, the Lees' ancestral home. Another son, however, became the family's redeeming figure--Robert E. Lee, a brilliant tactician whose ruling motto was self-denial and who saw God's hand in all things. In these and numerous other portraits, Nagel discloses how, from 1640 to 1870, a family spirit united the Lees, making them a force in Virginian and American affairs.<br> Paul Nagel is a leading chronicler of families prominent in our history. His <em>Descent from Glory</em>, a masterful narrative account of four generations of Adamses, was a Book-of-the-Month Club main selection and a brilliant critical and popular success. <em>The New Yorker</em> hailed it as "intelligent, tactful, and spiritually generous," and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian W.A. Swanberg, in the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, called it "a magnificent embarrassment of biographical riches." Now, in <em>The Lees of Virginia</em>, Nagel brings his skills to bear on another major American family, taking readers inside the great estates of the Old Dominion and the turbulent lives of the Lee men and women.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Paul C. Nagel</strong> was Director of the Virginia Historical Society until 1985, when he turned entirely to writing biography. His most recent books include <em>Descent From Glory</em> and <em>The Adams Women</em>. He is a contributing editor of <em>American Heritage</em>, a trustee of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, a fellow of the Society of American Historians, and past president of the Southern Historical essociation.<br>Nagel offers a generous history of seven generations of the family famous for Confederate General Robert E. Lee, starting from the family's first U.S. settlers, Richard and Anne Lee. Nagel's research is impeccable, and the historical value great. But despite Nagel's excellence, the reading of this saga makes the work difficult to appreciate, let alone finish. Lewis's high, nasal voice is unadorned by inflection, save for an annoying lift of half an octave whenever quotation marks appear in the text. Since Nagel sprinkles these throughout the story, the audible effect distracts significantly. R.P.L.

With the rise of the 401(k) and demise of the pension, the United States has embarked upon the richest and riskiest experiment in our financial history. Over the next twenty years, nearly eighty million baby boomers will retire at a pace of ten thousand per day. The hypothesis of our experiment is that millions of ordinary, untrained, busy citizens can successfully manage trillions of dollars in a financial system dominated by wealthy, skilled, and powerful financial institutions, many of which have a record of treating individual investors shabbily.<br><br>The key tools in our 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts are mutual funds, which have ballooned to hold more than $16 trillion. But these funds pose dangers to our savings in three ways: through structural vulnerabilities that give money managers the incentive to focus on marketing over investing; through the very human challenges of managing our savings decades into the future; and through the peril of financial professionals behaving badly, to our economic harm.<br><br>Though Americans often hear of the importance of low fees in fund investing, few are aware of the astonishing panoply of ways that some financial advisers have illegally diverted money out of mutual funds: from abetting hedge funds to trade after the legal deadline, to inflating the assets on which they are paid a percentage, to paying kickbacks for brokers to sell their funds. This book will forewarn and forearm Americans by illustrating the structural flaws, perverse incentives, and litany of scandals that have bedeviled mutual funds. <br><br>And by setting forth a pair of policy solutions to improve Americans' financial literacy and bargaining power, it will also attempt to safeguard our individual financial destinies and our nation's fiscal strength.<br></p><p><br>William Birdthistle is a Professor of Law at Chicago-Kent College of Law, where he specializes in investment funds and corporate law.

Generations of readers have thrilled to <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho,</i> one of the most popular of the early Gothic novels and a landmark in the realm of psychological fiction.<br> Set in 1584, the tale unfolds amid the secret chambers of a chateau in southern France and a castle in the remote Apennines, populated by pirates, brigands, ghosts, and specters. Emily St. Aubert, imprisoned by her rapacious guardian and his sadistic wife, struggles to reconcile her father&#x2019;s teachings of reserve and moderation with her own reckless passions. Emily&#x2019;s attempts to control her emotions and resolve her suspicions and self-doubts offer a haunting and hypnotic pre-Freudian exploration of the psyche.<br> Sir Walter Scott proclaimed author Ann Radcliffe &#x201c;the first poetess of romantic fiction,&#x201d; and this thriller became a bestseller upon its 1794 publication. The novel exercised a powerful influence on the Marquis de Sade, Edgar Allan Poe, and other mystery writers. It achieved further renown with a satirical treatment in Jane Austen&#x2019;s <i>Northanger Abbey,</i> in which an impressionable young character is profoundly affected by the dungeons and crypts of Castle Udolpho and their scenes of bloodshed, mayhem, and terror. <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> continues to enchant modern readers with the fairy-tale elements of its suspenseful plot and its dreamlike, surrealistic portrayals of human consciousness.</p><p>Ann Radcliffe (9 July 1764 &#x2013; 7 February 1823) was an English author and a pioneer of the Gothic novel. Her style is romantic in its vivid descriptions of landscapes and long travel scenes, yet the Gothic element is obvious through her use of the supernatural. It was her technique of explained Gothicism, the final revelation of inexplicable phenomena, that helped the Gothic novel achieve respectability in the 1790s.</p><h2>Occupational Therapy Evaluation for Children: A Pocket Guide</h2><p>The purpose of this book is to provide occupational therapy fieldwork students and novice practitioners with a quick guide to evaluation for children. This book will help students and practitioners perform efficient but comprehensive evaluations. Features include a step-by-step guide to the evaluation process, guidelines for selecting appropriate standardized and non-standardized tests, practical advice for meeting documentation requirements, and appendices with a number of sample evaluation reports.</p><p></p><h2>So The Wind Won&#39;t Blow it all Away</h2><p>It is 1979, and a man is recalling the events of his twelfth summer, when he bought bullets for his gun instead of a hamburger. Written just before his death, this novel foreshadowed Brautigan&#39;s suicide. It was originally published in 1982.</p><p>Richard Brautigan was born in Tacoma, Washington where he spent much of his youth, before moving to San Francisco where he became involved with other writers in the Beat Movement. During the sixties he became one of the most prolific and prominent members of the counter-cultural movement, and wrote some of his most famous novels including Trout Fishing in America, Sombrero Fallout and A Confederate General from Big Sur.He was found dead in 1984, aged 49, beside a bottle of alcohol and a .44 calibre gun. His daughter, Ianthe Brautigan, has written a biography of her father, You Can&#39;t Catch Death.Poetic, gently eccentric and deeply poignant, the story is a fitting swansong for his life. * * The Times * * Life is taken back to bare essentials in his books, never more so than here but life is never so rich. If someone ever made a movie of this, good people would watch it a hundred times and never tire of it. * * Beat Scene * * The verbal humour and zany charm of the book remain quite irresistible. * * Daily Telegraph * * Brautigan gets you drunk on similes, knocks you out with exquisite turns of phrase and leaves you with an ending that hits the entire novel out of the ballpark ... Amazing. * * Uncut * *</p><h2>Rock And Roll: A Social History</h2><p>The social force of rock and roll music leaps off the page as Paul Friedlander provides impressive insights based on hits from Johnny B. Goode&#x201d; to Walk on the Wild Side&#x201d; and beyond. In this musical journey, he offers the melodious strains and hard-edged riffs of Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Who, Dylan, Clapton, Doo-Wop, Motown, the San Francisco Beat, New Wave, rap, and much more. The book is written in a refreshing, captivating style that pulls the reader in, offering no less than a complete social and cultural history of rock and roll for students and general audiences alike.Friedlander writes, This book chronicles the first thirty years of rock/pop music history. Picture the various musical styles as locations on a giant unfolding road map. As you open the map, you travel from place to place, stopping at each chapter to sample the artistry. Take in the tales, pictures, sounds, and feelings of each location; remember the people you met there. Don't forget to dress your imagination appropriately for this trip, because each genre is affected by the societal topography and climate that surround it.&#x201d; Enjoy your trip. We promise it will be a good one!</p><p><b>Dr. Paul Friedlander</b> is Director of California State University, Chico Music Industry Program. He is author of the Encyclopedia Americana Rock Music&#x201d; entry, many book chapters and journal articles, and is past-president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music/American Chapter. As a musician, he has sung with Pete Seeger's Children's Chorus at Carnegie Hall, played bluegrass banjo at southern music festivals, hit notes with New York homeboys The Chapters, played folk music in Moscow's Gorki Park, and rock and rolled across the U.S.A.As rock and roll enters its fifth decade, critics and scholars have taken up the gauntlet to chart its evolution and examine it within the context of late-20th century civilization. Friedlander, a professor at the Conservatory of Music/University of the Pacific, has done his research, reading Robert Palmer on blues, Dick Hebdige on punk and Tricia Rose on rap, among many others. Still, his tome, despite its subtitle, is better read as a catalogue of rock trivia than as a critique. At the outset, Friedlander traces how gospel, country and blues have influenced everyone from Marvin Gaye and Elvis to the Who. Looking back across classic, alternative, punk and folk rock, Friedlander postulates a rather obvious recipe for success: seizing the moment and having a team approach (talent, manager, producer label support). In his conclusion, he speculates on the oligarchy of the few record labels which now dominate the industry. Although not the definitive cultural critique of rock and roll, this does have an appealing tone as Friedlander combines the ebullience of an amateur with the technical fluency of a musician.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Electric Energy: An Introduction, Third Edition (Power Electronics and Applications Series)</h2><p><p>The search for renewable energy and smart grids, the societal impact of blackouts, and the environmental impact of generating electricity, along with the new ABET criteria, continue to drive a renewed interest in electric energy as a core subject.

The Third Edition of Prealgebra, emphasizes Elayn Martin-Gay&#39;s unmatched ability to explain key concepts, build problem-solving skills, and relate to students through the use of real-life applications that are interesting, relevant and practical. Now in full color, the text retains the numerous features that contributed to the success of the previous editions. This updated revision includes an increased emphasis on geometry--with a new chapter devoted to Geometry and Measurement--along with new coverage of probability, additional coverage of percent and rates and an increased emphasis on reading graphs to expand students&#39; problem solving opportunities.</p><p>This text&#39;s clear, well-constructed and straightforward writing style makes it accessible to even the most apprehensive math students. The primary focus of the pedagogy, presentation and other elements is to ease the transition into algebra; for example, emphasis is placed on basic arithmetic operations within algebraic contexts. The Second Edition includes a greater integration of NCTM and AMATYC standards, including more emphasis on visualization, problem solving and data analysis.Preface ABOUT THE BOOK <p> This book was written to help students make the transition from arithmetic to algebra. To reach this goal, I introduce algebraic concepts early and repeat them as I treat traditional arithmetic topics, thus laying the groundwork for the next algebra course your students will take. A second goal was to show students the relevancy of the mathematics in everyday life and in the workplace. </p><p> In preparing this third edition, I considered the comments and suggestions of colleagues throughout the country and of the many users of previous editions. The numerous features that contributed to the success of the second edition have been retained. This updated revision includes new mathematical content and increased attention to geometric concepts, data interpretation, problem solving, and real-life applications. I have carefully chosen pedagogical features to help students understand and retain concepts. The AMATYC Crossroads in Mathematics document and the NCTM Standards (plus Addenda) also influenced the careful reexamination of every section of the text. The key content and pedagogical features are described on this and the following pages. </p><p> In addition, the supplements to this text have been enhanced and the range of supplements increased, offering a complete integrated teaching and learning package for maximum support and effectiveness. KEY PEDAGOGICAL FEATURES IN THE THIRD EDITION </p><p> Readability and Connections. Many reviewers of this edition as well as users of the previous editions have commented favorably on the readability and clear, organized presentation. I have tried to make the writing style as clear as possible while still retaining the mathematical integrity of the content. As new topics are presented, efforts have been made to relate the new ideas to those that the students may already know. Constant reinforcement and connections within problem-solving strategies, geometric concepts, pattern recognition, and situations from everyday life can help students gradually master both new and old information. </p><p> Accessible Real-World Applications. An abundance of new practical applications are found throughout the book in worked-out examples and exercise sets. The applications were carefully chosen to be accessible, to help motivate students, and to strengthen their understanding of mathematics in the real world. They help show connections to a wide range of fields such as agriculture, allied health, astronomy, automotive ownership and maintenance, aviation, biology, business, chemistry, communication, computer technology, construction, consumer affairs, cooking, demographics, earth science, education, entertainment, environmental issues, finance and economics, food service, geography, government, history, hobbies, labor and career issues, life science, medicine, music, nutrition, physics, political science, population, recreation, sports, technology, transportation, travel, weather, and important related mathematical areas such as geometry, statistics, and probability. (See also the Index of Applications on page xx.) Many of the applications are based on recent and interesting real-life data. Sources for data include newspapers, magazines, government publications, publicly held companies, special interest groups, research organizations, and reference books. Opportunities for obtaining your own real data are also included. </p><p> Problem-Solving Process. This is formally introduced in Chapter 3 with a four-step process that is integrated throughout the text. The four steps are Understand, Translate, Solve, and Interpret. The repeated use of these steps in a variety of examples shows their wide applicability. Reinforcing the steps can increase students' comfort level and confidence when solving problems. </p><p> Unique Exercise Sets. Each section ends with an Exercise Set, divided in parts. All parts contain graded exercises. Each exercise in the set, except those found in the parts labeled Review and Preview or Combining Concepts, is keyed to at least one of the objectives of the section. As appropriate, exercises are also keyed to one or more specific worked examples in the text. Exercises and examples marked with a video cassette icon have been worked out step-by-step by the author in the videos that accompany this text. </p><p> Throughout the exercise sets, there is an emphasis on Data and Graphical Interpretation via tables, charts, and graphs. The ability to interpret data and read and create a variety of types of graphs is developed gradually so students become comfortable with it. In addition, sections in Chapter 8 reinforce and extend these concepts. Similarly, throughout the text there is integration of Geometric Concepts, such as perimeter and area. Chapter 9 then provides a concise introduction and further coverage of geometry. A geometry icon o indicates exercises, examples or full sections involving geometric concepts. </p><p> In addition to the approximately 4400 exercises in end-of-section exercise sets, exercises may also be found in the Pretests, Integrated Reviews, Chapter Reviews, Chapter Tests, and Cumulative Reviews. Each exercise set contains one or more of the following features. </p><p> Mental Mathematics. These problems are found at the beginning of many exercise sets. They are mental warmups that reinforce concepts found in the accompanying section and increase students' confidence before they tackle an exercise set. By relying on their own mental skills, students increase not only their confidence in themselve but also their number sense and estimation ability. </p><p> Review and Preview. Formerly called Review Exercises, these exercises occur in each exercise set (except for those in Chapter 1). These problems are keyed to earlier sections and review concepts learned earlier in the text that are needed in the next section or in the next chapter. These exercises show the links between earlier topics and later material. </p><p> NEW! Combining Concepts. These exercises are found at the end of each exercise set after the Review and Preview exercises. New to this edition, Combining Concepts exercises require students to combine several concepts from that section or to take the concepts of the section a step further by combining them with concepts learned in previous sections. For instance, sometimes students are required to combine the concepts of a section with the problem-solving process they learned in Chapter 3 to try their hand at solving an application problem. In addition, there are conceptual exercises that occur outside the Combining Concepts part of the exercise set, and these are keyed with an icon. </p><p> Writing Exercises. These exercises, found in almost every exercise set, are keyed with a pencil icon. They require students to show an understanding of a concept learned in the corresponding section. This is accomplished by asking students questions that require them to stop, think, and explain in their own words the concepts) used in the exercises they have just completed. Guidelines recommended by the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC Crossroads in Mathematics guidelines) and other professional groups suggest incorporating writing in mathematics courses to reinforce concepts. </p><p> NEW! Internet Excursions. New to this edition, these exercises occur once per chapter. Internet Excursions require students to use the internet as a source of information or a data-collection tool to complete the exercises, allowing students first-hand experience with manipulating and working with real data. </p><p> Practice Problems. Throughout the text, each worked example has a parallel problem called a Practice Problem, found in the margin. Practice Problems invite students to be actively involved in the learning process before beginning the section exercise set. Practice Problems immediately reinforce a skill or concept as it is being developed. </p><p> NEW! Concept Checks. These new margin exercises are appropriately placed in many sections of the text. They invite students to immediately check their conceptual understanding as material is developed, offering an additional way to actively involve students in the learning process. </p><p> NEW! Integrated Reviews. These "mid-chapter reviews" are appropriately placed once per chapter. The new Integrated Reviews allow students to review and assimilate the many different skills learned separately over several sections before moving on to related material in the chapter. </p><p> NEW! Helpful Hints. Helpful Hints, formerly Reminders, contain practical advice on applying mathematical concepts. These are found throughout the text and strategically placed where students are most likely to need immediate reinforcement. Helpful Hints are highlighted for quick reference. </p><p> Focus On. Appropriately placed throughout each chapter, these are divided into Focus on Study Skills, Focus on Mathematical Connections, Focus on Business and Career, Focus on the Real World, and Focus on History. They are new to this edition and written to help students develop effective habits for studying mathematics, engage in investigations of other branches of mathematics, and understand the importance of mathematics in various careers and in the world of business. They help show the relevance of mathematics in both the present and past through critical thinking exercises and group activities. </p><p> Calculator Explorations. These optional explorations offer point-of-use instruction, through examples and exercises, on the proper use of calculators as tools in the mathematical problem-solving process. Placed appropriately throughout the text, Calculator Explorations also reinforce concepts learned in the corresponding section. </p><p> Additional exercises building on the skill developed in the Explorations may be found in exercise sets throughout the text. Exercises requiring a calculator are marked with a calculator icon. The inside back cover of the text includes a brief description of selected keys on a scientific calculator for reference as desired. </p><p> Chapter Activity. These features, formerly Group Activity, occur once per chapter at the end of the chapter, often serving as a chapter wrap-up. For individual or group completion, the Chapter Activity, usually hands-on or data based, complements and extends the concepts of the chapter, allowing students to make decisions and interpretations and to think and write about mathematics. </p><p> Visual Reinforcement of Concepts. The text contains a wealth of graphics, models, photographs, and illustrations to visually clarify and reinforce concepts. These include bar graphs, line graphs, calculator screens, application illustrations, and geometric figures. </p><p> NEW! Pretests. New to this edition, each chapter begins with a pretest that is designed to help students identify areas where they need to pay special attention in the upcoming chapter. </p><p> Chapter Highlights. Found at the end of each chapter, these contain key definitions, concepts, and examples to help students understand and retain what they have learned. </p><p> Chapter Review and Test. The end of each chapter contains a review of topics introduced in the chapter. The Chapter Review offers exercises that are keyed to sections of the chapter. The Chapter Test is a practice test and is not keyed to sections of the chapter. </p><p> Cumulative Review. These are found at the end of each chapter (except Chapter 1). Each problem contained in the cumulative review is actually an earlier worked example in the text that is referenced in the back of the book along with the answer. Students who need to see a complete worked-out solution, with explanation, can do so by turning to the appropriate example in the text. </p><p> Student Resource Icons. At the beginning of each section, videotape, software, study guide, and solutions manual icons are displayed. These icons help reinforce that these learning aids are available should students wish to use them to help them review concepts and skills at their own pace. These items have direct correlation to the text and emphasize the text's methods of solution. </p><p> NEW! Functional Use of Color and Design. Elements of the text are now highlighted with full color or design to make it easier for students to read and study. Color is also used to clarify the problem-solving process in worked examples. NEW KEY CONTENT FEATURES IN THE THIRD EDITION </p><p> Greater Emphasis on Geometry. There is increased emphasis and coverage of geometric concepts. This was accomplished by retaining the early introduction and integration of the concepts of perimeter and area (see Sections 1.2 and 1.5), strengthening the coverage of geometry within sections (see Sections 3.1 and 5.8), and providing a new chapter on Geometry and Measurement together with an Integrated Review dedicated to geometry concepts (see Chapter 9). A geometry icon indicates exercises, examples, or full sections involving geometric concepts. </p><p> Designed to be as flexible as possible, instructors may elect to use the new chapter as a convenient unit on geometry or use a section or sections in conjunction with earlier chapters. For instance, Section 9.3 on perimeter may be taught anytime after Section 3.5. </p><p> There is a geometry appendix containing a review of geometric figures and a new appendix contains coverage of surface area. The inside front cover of this text provides a summary of geometric formulas for easy reference. Formulas include perimeter, area, volume, circumference, and surface area. </p><p> The sections on geometry and measurement are written to help increase students' spatial sense, relate general geometric ideas to number and measurement ideas, and make and use estimates of measurement. </p><p> Expanded Coverage of Ratio and Proportion. The treatment of ratio and proportion now includes separate sections on rates (see Section 6.2) and proportions and problem solving (see Section 6.4). </p><p> The chapter on percent now offers full section coverage of solving percent problems with equations and solving percent problems with proportions (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3). The expanded coverage of ratio and proportion allows for an increased number of application problems, and increased flexibility in the amount and use of topics needed for students to succeed in both this course and future courses. </p><p> Increased Attention to Reading Graphs. The widely praised treatment of reading and interpreting graphs has been expanded to two sections (see Sections 8.1 and 8.2). In addition, there has been a significant increase in the number of examples and exercises throughout the text using a graph, table, or chart. </p><p> Probability. A new section on Counting and Introduction to Probability has been added to this edition (see Section 8.6). It provides for exploring concepts of chance and expanding students' number sense. The topic of probability is included in the AMATYC Crossroads in Mathematics content guidelines. </p><p> Solving Equations. Special emphasis is given to the addition property of equality and the multiplication property of equality (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). </p><p> Increased Opportunities to Use Technology. Optional calculator explorations and exercises are integrated appropriately throughout the text. </p><p> New Examples. Additional detailed step-by-step examples were ad...</p></p><h2>Jo&#39;s Boys</h2><p>Best known for the novels <b>Little Women</b><i> </i>and <i>Little Men,</i> Louisa May Alcott brought the story of her feisty protagonist Jo and the adventures and misadventures of the March family to an entertaining, surprising, and bittersweet conclusion in <b>Jo&#x2019;s Boys</b>.

These twovenerable works are fixtures on the short lists for most valuablebooks on the securities markets, and investors continue to cherishthem." -From the Introduction by Martin S. Fridson ManagingDirector, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Author of InvestmentIllusions<br> <br> Exploring the sometimes hilarious, sometimes devastating impact ofcrowd behavior and trading trickery on the financial markets, thisbook brilliantly combines two all-time investment classics.Extraordinary Popular Delusions and Confusi�n de Confusionestake us from Tulipmania in 1634-when tulips actually traded at ahigher price than gold-to the South Sea "bubble" of 1720, andbeyond. Securities analyst and author Martin Fridson guides you ona quirky, entertaining, and intriguing journey back throughtime.<br> <br> Chosen by the Financial Times as Two of the Ten Best Books EverWritten on Investment<br> <br> Critical Praise . . .<br> <br> "This is the most important book ever written about crowdpsychology and, by extension, about financial markets. A seriousstudent of the markets and even anyone interested in the extremesof human behavior should read this book!" -Ron Insana, CNBC<br> <br> "In combining 'Extraordinary' with 'Confusion,' the result is notextraordinary confusion. Instead, with clarity, the book sears intomodern investor minds the dangers of following the crowd." -GregHeberlein, The Seattle Times<br> <br> "You will see between its staid lines (written in ye olde Englishand as ponderable as Buddha's navel) that, despite what the mediasays, nothing really important has changed in the financial marketsin centuries." -Kenneth L. Fisher, Forbes</p><p>Why do otherwise intelligent individuals form seething masses of idiocy when they engage in collective action? Why do financially sensible people jump lemming-like into harebrained speculative frenzies -- only to jump broker-like out of windows when their fantasies dissolve? We may think that the Great Crash of 1929, junk bonds of the '80s, and overvalued high-tech stocks of the '90s are peculiarly 20th century aberrations, but the excerpts of these two classics--first published in 1841 and 1688, respectively--show that the madness and confusion of crowds knows no limits, and has no temporal bounds. These are extraordinarily illuminating and, unfortunately, entertaining tales of chicanery, greed, and naivete. <b>Essential reading</b> for any student of human nature or the transmission of ideas. <p> In fact, cases such as Tulipomania in 1624--when tulip bulbs traded at a higher price than gold--suggest the existence of what I would dub "Mackay's Law of Mass Action": when it comes to the effect of social behavior on the intelligence of individuals, 1+1 is often considerably less than 1, and sometimes less than 0.</p>A unique and witty book consisting of selections from Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds and Confusion de Confusions. The combination of these two classics results in an accessible and fascinating assessment of crowd behavior, market movement and investment psychology.</p><h2>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

Jaworski came to realize that traditional analytical leadership approaches are inadequate for dealing creatively with this complexity. To effectively face these challenges, leaders need to access the Source from which truly profound innovation flows.<br><br> Many people, including Jaworski himself, have experienced a connection with this Source, often when called upon to respond in times of crisis&#x2014;moments of extreme spontaneity and intuitive insight. Actions simply flow through them, seemingly without any sort of conscious intervention. But these experiences are chance occurrences&#x2014;ordinarily, we don&#x2019;t know how to access the Source, and we even have a blind spot as to its very existence. <br><br> In an extraordinarily wide-ranging intellectual odyssey, Jaworski relates his fascinating experiences with quantum physicists, cognitive scientists, indigenous leaders, and spiritual thinkers, all focused on getting to the heart of the Source. Ultimately, he develops four guiding principles that encompass the nature of the Source and what we need to do to stay in dynamic dialogue with it.<br><br> Using the combination of narrative and reflection that made Synchronicity so compelling, Jaworski has written a book that illuminates the essential nature not only of visionary leadership but also of relationships, consciousness, and ultimately reality itself.</p><p>Joseph Jaworski is a founder and the chairman of both Generon International and the Global Leadership Initiative and is the founder of the American Leadership Forum.

While the first book concentrated on issues before 1900, this volume's statistic-packed and thoroughly documented narrative explores 20th-century advances in healthcare, the development of the insurance industry, declining support for public health, and the myriad social and economic factors that have had disparate impacts on the health of black Americans. Continuing a troubling theme from their first volume, the authors also probe the effects of racism in the medical professions, which led to pernicious eugenics theories and shocking medical experiments well into the 20th century. Both volumes of this landmark study are essential for medical and African American studies collections.

A long-time foreign and diplomatic correspondent for the NEW YORK TIMES, then an executive editor of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, he is now a fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He resides in Massachusetts.A compelling biography of a man who was present at the birth of America's foreign intelligence apparatus and went on to run the CIA under presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. Grose (A Changing Israel, 1985, etc.) demystifies the master spy and presents Dulles the man, brilliant in his career yet quite flawed in his personal life. A former New York Times reporter and managing editor of Foreign Affairs, the author says that he received no cooperation (and thus no censoring) from the CIA for this book. Dulles (18931969), he shows, came from a diplomatic lineage: His brother John Foster Dulles was Eisenhower's secretary of state, a position also held by their grandfather John W. Foster under Benjamin Harrison and by their uncle Robert Lansing under Woodrow Wilson. Nevertheless, it was against the wishes of his father, a Presbyterian minister, that Dulles pursued a career in the foreign service. Grose illustrates the contrast between John, the stern moralist, and his brother Allen, the bon vivant who often ignored his family not only for his work but also for several extramarital affairs. He got his first taste of intelligence work as a junior diplomat during WW I and, after leaving the diplomatic corps in the 1920s, prospered as an international lawyer. When the US entered WW II, Dulles joined the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA. The pinnacle of his career came when he was named to head the CIA at the height of the Cold War. Grose details CIA interventions in Guatemala and Iran as well as anti- Soviet intelligence operations. Grose also offers the necessary complement to any biography of Dulles--a thorough examination of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which led to his dismissal by Kennedy, who felt duped by the CIA into backing the anti-Castro invasion. Grose's outstanding study of a remarkable life gives readers insight into both a period of history and the development of the CIA. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

"I created the illustrations in this book to help bridge this gulf and allow us to look at the molecular structure of cells, if not directly, then in an artistic rendition." Goodsell has succeeded remarkably. His pictures, mostly line drawings, show the structures of crucial biochemicals and the boggling intricacy of their arrangement in living cells.

It provides a conceptual framework that includes exposure to all the necessary background material in all areas. <b> </b> A four-part presentation covers quantitative cell and tissue biology, cell and tissue characterization, engineering methods and design, and clinical implementation. <b> </b> For cell culture scientists and engineers. </p></p><p><p> Tissue engineering is a complex and emerging field of study that combines basis biological sciences (molecular, cell, and tissue biology and physiology), engineering fundamentals (fluid mechanics, transport phenomena, materials science, chemical kinetics), clinical aspects (surgery, transplantation, immunology, pathology, radiology) and biotechnology (cell culture, cell separations, gene transfer). All these disciplines converge to study of tissue dynamics that coordinate tissue repair, replacement, and reconstruction. These are procedures and therapies in which cells themselves act as the therapeutic agents. </p> <p> This book on tissue engineering is the first textbook in this field and it offers the convergence of important fundamental concepts in biology, engineering, medicine, and biotechnology. These diverse concepts are carefully organized and laid out in a clear framework to orient students entering the field. This framework includes four parts: </p> <ul> <li>Part I: Quantitative Cell and Tissue Biology&#x2014;Including tissue organization, tissue dynamics, morphogenesis, stem cells, cellular fate processes, and their coordination.</li> <li>Part II: Cell and Tissue Characterization-Including high-throughput technologies, cell and tissue properties, cell and tissue culture, and gene transfer</li> <li>Part III: Engineering Methods and Design-Including time constant analysis, scale-up procedures, cell separations, biomaterial scaffolds, and how to tailor biomaterials</li> <li>Part IV: Clinical Implementation-Including conventional approaches to tissue repair, host integration, and producing tissue-engineered therapies.</li> </ul> <p> This book thus offers the basics of this emerging field to the student and a framework in which instructors can build comprehensive courses, with the flexibility to emphasize and expand on any particular topic. </p><p> Tissue engineering holds the promise to repair or replace damaged organs. As a discipline, the field has evolved dramatically from its origins in the late 1980s. In particular, the rapid advances in stem cell biology have rekindled the enthusiasm use cell-based approaches for the treatment of disease. For success in this area, must learn to manipulate, produce, and deliver collections of cells as building blocks of tissues. Transplanted cells and tissue constructs are influenced by their microenvironment and can be manipulated to effectively interact with patients. </p> <p> The underpinnings of tissue engineering are thus broad, and span a wide spectrum of scientific and engineering fundamentals. This list includes basic biological sciences (cell biology, physiology, embryology, and wound healing); engineering fundamentals (fluid dynamics, transport phenomena, materials science, mechanics, and chemical kinetics); many clinical aspects (surgery and transplantation, immunology, pathology, radiology, and medicine), and various relevant biotechnologies (cell culture, cell separation, and gene transfer). This long list of specialized knowledge makes it challenging to organize all the necessary background material for the student of tissue engineering in a clear and succinct manner. </p> <p> In writing this book, we aimed to lay the foundation for students studying tissue engineering at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. We have attempted to provide a conceptual framework that includes exposure to all of the necessary background material. Thus, we cannot treat any particular subject in great detail but rather can provide the needed conceptual background in all areas. Instructors will find this text to be a useful framework since it is amenable to augmentation based on the instructors area of expertise and desired focus of a course in tissue engineering. The text is written primarily for senior bioengineering students or first-year graduate students and assumes a working knowledge of the engineering fundamentals. In this spirit, we have provided a series of engineering-style homework problems and solutions in order to allow students to work through the concepts presented. Nonetheless, we also hope that the text will be useful to traditional engineering students, material scientists, medical students, laypeople, and biologists. </p> <p> We have chosen to present the material in four parts: quantitative cell and tissue biology, cell and tissue characterization, engineering methods and design, and clinical implementation. Throughout the text, we have emphasized relevant time and length scales of physicochemical processes in cell biology and medicine. Armed with these fundamentals, we seek to have students establish a conceptual framework within which to place further advances in the field. Many societal and technical challenges still remain for the field to move forward, and we have highlighted these to the extent possible. </p> <p> Writing a textbook like this one is a significant undertaking. There are many individuals and organizations to thank for helping us with various aspects of the writing process. The Whitaker Foundation generously provided financial support for this project through their Teaching Materials program. Their recognition that textbooks are required to build consensus and firmly establish a field will be an important part of their legacy. Two individuals were key in preparing this text. Marc Abrams tirelessly assisted in compiling all aspects of this text and prepared it using LATEX, which made the production and publication an easier process. Salman Khetani made heroic efforts in reading all of the material in detail and offering perceptive criticism, suggestions, and input that significantly improved the quality of the text. He and Valerie Liu provided important feedback on their experience teaching from this text and help with preparing homework problems. Christophe Schilling, Ramprasad Ramakrishna, Jason Papin, Stephen Fong, and Timothy Allen also provided help with homework problems. Some individuals provided significant help with particular chapters; Nathan Price and Karl Francis with Chapter 6, Jason Papin with Chapter 7, and Markus Herrgard with Chapter 8. Michelle Williamson provided the original illustrations. </p> <p> A number of individuals assisted in proofreading the text; including Tim Allen, Derren Barken, Markus Covert, Iman Famili, Steve Fong, Anu Raghunathan, Jennifer Reed, Sharon Wiback, Kanika Chawala, and Thuy Vo. Many of our colleagues have provided feedback, pointed us to important resources, or shared preprints and course notes. Thanks go especially to Francois Berthiaume, John Bischof, Christopher Chen, Tejal Desai, Jennifer Elisseeff, Robert Sah, Fred Schoen, Mehmet Toner, and Peter Zandstra. </p> <p> Finally, we wish to thank our families for their support of this seemingly never-ending project. In particular, Sangeeta thanks her husband, Jagesh, for his insight and love and her Dad, Narain, for his encouragement and wisdom. </p> <p> Bernhard Palsson has a number of people and institutions to thank. The Fulbright and Ib Henriksen Foundations provided him with fellowship support to spend a leave at the Technical University of Denmark in 1996. Jens Nielsen and John Villadsen acted as his hosts and encouraged him to prepare a series of lectures on tissue engineering during his stay in Denmark. (Those lectures nucleated this book.) The Hougen Visiting Professorship at the University of Wisconsin in 2000 provided another leave during which portions of this text were written. He is grateful for the support and understanding of his wife Mahshid and children Shireen and Sirus who helped with the preparation of the index of this book. </p> <p> BERNHARD O.

Based on more than thirty years of research and packed with illustrative cases and solid systems theory on human interaction, <i>Seeing Systems</i> provides a penetrating look at the dynamics of systems and a unique foundation for revolutionizing our understanding of system life. This new edition features an extensive new section on having the wisdom and courage to face and work with the reality of uncertainty, and a new epilogue describing how Oshry is currently using theater, blogs, and podcasts to extend his multi-pronged revolution aimed at transforming system blindness into system sight.</p><p>Seeing Systems is the most accessible, penetrating book available on the dynamics of systems. In it, Barry Oshry explains why so many efforts at creating more satisfying and productive systems end in disappointment, and proposes an entirely new framework for dealing with human behavior. Oshry shows us how teams of top executives regularly fall into turf battles with one another; why organizational improvement efforts inevitably create tensions between the &#34;&#34;good&#34;&#34; cooperative workers and the &#34;&#34;bad&#34;&#34; resistant ones; how marriages seemingly &#34;&#34;made in heaven&#34;&#34; disintegrate. Oshry demonstrates how these breakdowns in organizations result from our blindness to the human systems of which we are a part. Finally, he shows how powerful, productive, and satisfying partnerships are created when we are able to recognize and stop these destructive &#34;&#34;dances&#34;&#34;, and create new ones in which we understand and are respectful of one another and can work in productive partnership. Seeing Systems takes us to a whole new level of understanding ourselves as human beings.Barry Oshry is the founder of Power + Systems, Inc., developer of the Power Lab and the Organization Workshop on Creating Partnership, and the author of Leading Systems.</p><h2>Greek Lyric Poetry: The Poems and Fragments of the Greek Iambic, Elegiac, and Melic Poets (Excluding Pindar and Bacchylides) Down to 450 BC (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The Greek lyric, elegiac, and iambic poets of the two centuries from 650 to 450 BC - Archilochus and Alcman, Sappho and Mimnermus, Anacreon, Simonides, and the rest - produced some of the finest poetry of antiquity, perfect in form, spontaneous in expression, reflecting all the joys and<br>anxieties of their personal lives and of the societies in which they lived.<br><br>This new poetic translation by a leading expert captures the nuances of meaning and the whole spirit of this poetry as never before.

In <em>The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French</em>, readers will have at their fingertips a trusted guide to this rich literary heritage.<br>Written by an international team of experts, the <em>Companion's</em> 3,000 entries capture ten centuries of work produced in France and, more recently, in other French-speaking countries around the world. The coverage they provide is superb. The volume highlights not only poets, novelists, and dramatists, but also historians, scientists, statesmen, and philosophers--providing a sweeping tour of French culture. Here readers will find lengthy articles on the giants of French letters, from Voltaire, Flaubert, and Balzac, to Valery, Cocteau, and Sartre. Among the new features of the <em>Companion</em> are substantial essays that reflect the latest scholarship on topics such as literary movements and genres; historical subjects such as chivalry or Occupation and Resistance in wartime France; intellectual movements from Scholasticism to Feminism; linguistic topics; coverage of the sciences; and the arts and media, including opera, cinema, and journalism. There is generous coverage of painters such as Degas and Delacroix, and composers such as Meyerbeer and Debussy. Scientists and philosophers also appear in these pages (ranging from Poincare and Cuvier to Descartes, Pascal, and Rousseau). There is even an entertaining entry that cites 100 well-known quotations from French literature. Finally, the contributors have approached the literature of France in the widest terms possible, challenging the traditional canon as they examine everything from strip cartoons and pamphlets. Adventurous and wide ranging, the <em>New Companion</em> is more than a simple revision of the original work.<br>Whether you are interested in Condillac or Condorcet, Lamartine or Lamarck, Madame de Stael or Madame Deficit (Marie-Antoinette), <em>The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French</em> provides informed and engaging coverage of the vast literary tradition of France.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter France</strong> is Professor Emeritus and Endowment Fellow of Edinburgh University.<br>Nearly four decades have elapsed since the publication of <i>The Oxford Companion to French Literature</i> (<i>OCFL</i>) in 1959, and almost 20 years since the abridged and revised version, <i>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of French Literature</i> (1976). However, as the editor, a professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, notes in his introduction, <i>The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French</i> (<i>NOCLF</i>) is not simply an updated edition of these earlier works, but a completely new compilation.<p>The changed title reflects the most significant difference: coverage now extends beyond literature produced in France to encompass francophone writing from throughout the world. The <i>NOCLF</i> not only treats individual writers from many countries, but also provides broad survey articles on the literature of each area, for example, <i>Africa </i>(<i>South of the Sahara</i>), <i>Belgian Literature in French</i>, <i>Haiti</i>, <i>Quebec</i>. In addition, this new companion reflects the shifting perceptions of the literary canon by embracing more women writers and popular literature, and it gives greater emphasis to literature produced in the last half of this century. It also recognizes the increased influence of popular culture by including such entries as <i>Chevalier, Maurice</i>; <i>Detective Fiction</i>; and <i>Tintin</i>.</p><p>The approximately 3,000 alphabetically arranged entries were written by France or a member of an international team of 130 scholars. The majority are limited to a single paragraph, but major authors, such as Marguerite Duras, Victor Hugo, and Voltaire, receive more extensive treatment, as do topics of a more general nature, for instance, <i>Feminism</i> and <i>Versification</i>. The longer articles are generally accompanied by one or two bibliographic references.</p><p>The generous provision of <i>see</i> references greatly facilitates use, and a list near the front of the volume groups selected entries into broad topical categories such as <i>Intellectual and Cultural Movements</i> and <i>Literary and Theatrical Genres</i>. Other helpful features include a chronological chart linking specific authors with events in France and other French-speaking countries and a section of maps of France, its colonies, and Paris.</p><p>No other English-language compilation offers the breadth of coverage of the <i>NOCLF</i>. However, Anthony Levi's two-volume <i>Guide to French Literature</i> (St. James, 1992^-94) provides more in-depth treatment of 326 major French writers and literary movements, and Sandra W. Dolbow's <i>Dictionary of Modern French Literature: From the Age of Reason through Realism</i> (Greenwood, 1986) covers the period 1715^-1880 in greater detail.</p><p>This new Oxford companion is an important acquisition for public and academic libraries. However, even with its expanded scope, it has only half the number of entries of the <i>OCFL</i>. Because hundreds of minor authors, historical figures, geographic entities, titles, characters, and literary allusions have either been dropped or incorporated into more general articles, librarians may want to consider retaining one or both of this work's predecessors.

Han's richly textured, panoramic view of late-nineteenth-century Shanghai follows a range of characters from beautiful sing-song girls to lower-class prostitutes and from men in positions of social authority to criminals and ambitious young men recently arrived from the country. Considered one of the greatest works of Chinese fiction, <i>The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai</i> is now available for the first time in English. <br><br>Neither sentimental nor sensationalistic in its portrayal of courtesans and their male patrons, Han's work inquires into the moral and psychological consequences of desire. Han, himself a frequent habitu� of Shanghai brothels, reveals a world populated by lonely souls who seek consolation amid the pleasures and decadence of Shanghai's demimonde. He describes the romantic games played by sing-song girls to lure men, as well as the tragic consequences faced by those who unexpectedly fall in love with their customers. Han also tells the stories of male patrons who find themselves emotionally trapped between desire and their sense of propriety. <br><br>First published in 1892, and made into a film by Hou Hsiao-hsien in 1998, <i>The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai</i> is recognized as a pioneering work of Chinese fiction in its use of psychological realism and its infusion of modernist sensibilities into the traditional genre of courtesan fiction. The novel's stature has grown with the recent discovery of Eileen Chang's previously unknown translation, which was unearthed among her papers at the University of Southern California. Chang, who lived in Shanghai until 1956 when she moved to California and began to write in English, is one of the most acclaimed Chinese writers of the twentieth century.</p><p>Considered one of the great works of Chinese fiction, <i>The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai</i> is a story of desire and virtue set in the pleasure quarters of nineteenth-century Shanghai.

From beautiful sirens to lower-class prostitutes, from well-respected patrons to repugnant criminals, <i>The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai</i> brings the romantic games of the sing-song girls to vivid life, as well as the tragic consequences faced by those who unexpectedly fall in love with their customers. Han Bangqing also tells his story from a male point of view, revealing the danger of becoming trapped between desire and propriety.

This new collection of essays from the series does for modern ethics what <em>The Stone Reader</em> did for modern philosophy. <em>New York Times</em> editor Peter Catapano and best-selling author and philosopher Simon Critchley have curated an unparalleled collection that illuminates just how imperative ethical thinking is in our day-to-day life.</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments</em> explores long-standing ethical and moral issues in light of our most urgent dilemmas. Divided into twelve sections, the book opens with a series of broad arguments on existence, human nature and morality. Indeed, &#x201c;big&#x201d; questions of the human condition are explored by some of our best-known and most accomplished living philosophers: <em>What is the meaning of our existence? Should we really &#x201c;do what we love&#x201d;? How should we respond to evil? Is pure altruism possible?</em></p><p>Along with these examinations of timeless moral conundrums, readers will find arguments in the more contentious areas of religion and government: <em>Can we have a moral life without God? Does it really matter if God exists? Is patriotism moral?</em> Accessible and provocative, these pieces expose the persistence of the most basic themes and questions of moral and ethical life. Many of the essays stress the crucial importance of directly engaging the most pressing moral dilemmas in modern life. <em>Should we be the last generation, knowing all the harm we&#x2019;ve done to our planet? Should we embrace our inner carnivores, or swear off all animal products?</em> From gun control and drone warfare to the morals of marriage and reproduction, readers will view familiar debates in new, surprising lights.</p><p>The editors have meticulously arranged this book to reflect a wide range of perspectives, voices and rhetorical strategies.

In this third volume of a new Loeb Classical Library edition of Aristophanes, Jeffrey Henderson presents a freshly edited Greek text and a lively, unexpurgated translation of three plays with full explanatory notes.</p><p>In <i>Birds</i> Aristophanes turns from the pointed political satire characteristic of earlier plays to a fantasy that soars literally into the air in search of a carefree world. Here the enterprising protagonists create a utopian counter-Athens, called Cloudcuckooland, ruled by birds. <i>Lysistrata</i> blends boisterous comedy and an earnest call for peace. Lysistrata, our first comic heroine, organizes a panhellenic conjugal strike of young wives until their husbands end the war between Athens and Sparta. Athenian women again take center stage in <i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i>, this time to punish Euripides for portraying them as wicked. Parody of Euripides' plots enlivens this witty confrontation of the sexes.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Henderson is William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Boston University.

The detailed evidence assembled here shows that eighteenth-century Americans almost never invoked this principle. Although Thomas Jefferson and others retrospectively claimed that the First Amendment separated church and state, separation became part of American constitutional law only much later. </p><p> Hamburger shows that separation became a constitutional freedom largely through fear and prejudice. Jefferson supported separation out of hostility to the Federalist clergy of New England. Nativist Protestants (ranging from nineteenth-century Know Nothings to twentieth-century members of the K.K.K.) adopted the principle of separation to restrict the role of Catholics in public life. Gradually, these Protestants were joined by theologically liberal, anti-Christian secularists, who hoped that separation would limit Christianity and all other distinct religions. Eventually, a wide range of men and women called for separation. Almost all of these Americans feared ecclesiastical authority, particularly that of the Catholic Church, and, in response to their fears, they increasingly perceived religious liberty to require a separation of church from state. American religious liberty was thus redefined and even transformed. In the process, the First Amendment was often used as an instrument of intolerance and discrimination. </p></p><p>Philip Hamburger is Maurice and Hilda Friedman Professor of Law at the Columbia Law School.Philip Hamburger has, simply, produced the best and most important book ever written on the subject of the separation of church and state in the United States. He has laid to rest the historical credentials of the Jeffersonian myth of the "wall of separation," and shown how the notion of separation gained wide acceptance in the nineteenth century primarily due to the pervasiveness of American anti-Catholicism. He has also destroyed the notion that separation is the only alternative to the union of church and state, and demonstrated that acceptance of separation has in fact undermined the vitality of our original anti-establishment notions of religious freedom. Hamburger underplays the current constitutional implications of his historical arguments, but it is clear that this book will have a profound impact on the current law and politics of church and state.<br> --Stanley N. Katz, Princeton University, President, Emeritus, American Council of Learned Societies<br><br>This richly documented and cogently argued book challenges conventional interpretations of separation of church and state as a constitutional standard in American history and promises to reshape the debate on the constitutional and prudential relations between religion and American public life.<br> --Daniel L. Dreisbach, American University<br><br>Hamburger provides an alternate historical and political understanding concerning the development of the separation concept, relying on 17th-through 19th-century religious arguments and social patterns to challenge our accepted understanding of relationships between church and state...This clear historical analysis will be accessible to anyone interested in U.S. church-state relations and civil liberties. Highly recommended.<br> --Steven Puro (<i>Library Journal</i> 2002-05-15)<br><br>This volume presents the fascinating and complex history of interpretations of the First Amendment in the U.S. and argues that the amendment's antiestablishment clause did not mandate separation of church and state. Instead, Hamburger insists that separation, an idea that may mean far more than the absence of establishment, became a constitutional freedom over an extended period of time, largely through fear and prejudice...Recommended.<br> --S. C. Pearson (<i>Choice</i> 2002-12-01)<br><br>Hamburger has written an extremely important book. His prodigious learning and ingenious interpretations overturn the conventional wisdom, forcing even the most passionate defenders of separationism to recognize how much of the story of religious liberty has taken on mythical dimensions.<br> --Alan Wolfe (<i>Books and Culture</i> 2002-09-01)<br><br>[Hamburger] devastates Jefferson's notion of a 'wall of separation' between religion and government, demonstrating that such a notion was utterly idiosyncratic at the time. Strict separation was revived by anti-Catholics in the 19th century and picked up by the court in the 20th, a development for which Justice Hugo Black bore much responsibility. The modern era of judicial hostility to organized religion and its symbols in the public square is directly contrary to what the Framers meant when they prohibited the establishment of religion. Though Mr. Hamburger does not trace the damage done by preposterous decisions in recent decades, this is a marvelous book.<br> --Robert Bork (<i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2006-01-14)<br><br><i>Separation of Church and State</i> by Philip Hamburger is, perhaps, the most talked about treatise on American church-state relations of the last generation. It is a weighty, thoroughly researched tome that presents a nuanced, provocative thesis and that strikes even seasoned church-state scholars as distinctive from most works on the subject...Hamburger's fresh appraisal of the historical record adds much to our understanding of church-state separation...Few pages in this richly documented and cogently argued book fail to excite reflection or challenge long-held assumptions.<br> --Daniel Dreisbach (<i>American Journal of Legal History</i>)</p><h2>The Clayton M.

There are tons of health related books currently on the market.&nbsp; What was it about the subject you chose to write about in your book that made you feel so passionate about spreading the word and getting your book published?</b></p><p>South Asians, who are mostly Asian Indian, have one of the highest risks of heart disease and diabetes in the world, and most books and content don&#x2019;t address their needs in a culturally sensitive way. Conventional wisdom and advice about nutrition and disease nearly ruined my health, and I was seeing the same pattern repeated in my patients and the South Asian community at large.&nbsp; Having a family history of heart disease and/or diabetes was more the rule than the exception, and I was seeing too many Asian Indian patients having heart attacks in their 30s and 40s.&nbsp; The final straw was my wife, who is a pediatrician, regularly sharing stories of kids developing adult onset diabetes and adult-like cholesterol disorders.&nbsp; For the first time in human history, our children have a shorter projected lifespan than the generation before them.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&#x2019;s completely unacceptable and we can never call ourselves a progressive society until we fix that.</p><p><b></b><b>2. What is it in particular about your book that makes it such an essential must-have to anyone who is interested in improving their health?</b></p><p>Despite the title being &#x201c;South Asian,&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve shared the most effective dietary and lifestyle changes that have worked in patients of all cultural backgrounds.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ve had dramatic results in my South Asian consult patients who have shed body fat, dropped medications, and improved their energy level and overall quality of life within a relatively short time.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ve also had the opportunity to apply these principles on a larger scale to large companies with similar success.&nbsp; This book is a must-have because it doesn&#x2019;t just tell you to &#x201c;eat healthy and exercise more.&#x201d;&nbsp; It gives you practical methods that can fit into a busy, culturally diverse lifestyle with all its temptations and constraints.&nbsp; It also gives a family-centered, gender-sensitive, multigenerational approach to healthy living that includes chapters on pregnancy, childhood, women&#x2019;s health and aging.&nbsp; This isn&#x2019;t a battle we can win alone. Everyone needs to be on the same page and this book describes how.</p><p><b></b><b>3. What is your favorite part of your book and why?</b></p><p>I enjoyed sharing the patient stories (names changed) and my own personal struggles, since they added a more human touch to the book, rather than me just preaching to the reader.&nbsp; From a sedentary software engineer to a mother-daughter duo with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), I selected diverse stories that most people of any cultural background could relate to.&nbsp; Co-writing the children&#x2019;s chapter with my wife was especially enlightening since I got a deeper understanding of the challenges she faces in her pediatric clinic.&nbsp; I learned through her experience and definitive research how insulin resistance and heart disease starts early in life and is made worse by how we feed and raise our children.</p><p><b></b><b>4. What is the main problem that the subject of your book tackles?</b></p><p>Standard dietary guidelines, non-sustainable and inflexible advice about exercise, cultural myths, and the misinterpretation of key numbers like cholesterol panels are feeding the worsening problems of insulin resistance, obesity, heart disease and all chronic conditions including accelerated aging.</p><p><b></b><b>5. What tools does your book suggest readers use to solve this problem?</b></p><p>The book goes into details on which tests and numbers are the most important indicators of good health, using culturally adjusted parameters when appropriate.&nbsp; Many of my Indian heart attack patients were told their weight and cholesterol were &#x201c;normal&#x201d; by their prior doctors or were inappropriately put on medications when simple lifestyle changes could have resolved their issues.&nbsp; I also provide very specific nutrition advice that can be applied to virtually any diverse cuisine with an emphasis on vegetarian and non-vegetarian Indian diets.&nbsp; Finally, I share some of the most effective exercises, high-tech tools, and apps that have helped patients lose weight, manage stress, and get fit in the comfort of their own home or the convenience of their workplace.</p><p><b></b><b>6. What do you see as the essential important message readers will take away from your book?</b></p><p>Despite all of the barriers to good health we face each day, very specific and simple changes can result in profound improvements in mental and physical health.&nbsp; I&#x2019;ve had diehard, rice-eating Indian immigrants who have never exercised a day in their life lose weight, increase activity, and transform their bodies.&nbsp; There is a South Asian Health Solution for every individual regardless of their background.&nbsp; Patients and doctors need to be more creative in finding those answers and I&#x2019;m hoping this book will help.</p><p><b></b><b>7. What did you learn about yourself in the process of writing this book?</b></p><p>I realized that one of the greatest challenges to staying healthy is writing a book.&nbsp; Despite my busy day job, my mind and body were consumed 24/7 with voices echoing from my manuscript.&nbsp; This forced me to find even more time-efficient ways to combine work and exercise, like typing for hours while on an elliptical machine.&nbsp; I share these techniques in the book.</p><p><b></b><b>8. What did you discover about others during the process of writing this book?</b></p><p>A: An even greater level of empathy for the struggles people face in staying healthy.&nbsp; I used to think it was irrational for someone to not want to eat healthy and exercise.&nbsp; After gaining a deeper understanding of human behavior, brain function and the addictive nature of food, technology and being sedentary, I totally get why we&#x2019;re facing a current health crisis.</p><p><b></b><b>9. What quote from your book do you think best summarizes its content, over all message, and intent?</b></p><p>&#x201c;Today&#x2019;s modern lifestyle layered upon insulin resistant genes is a recipe for early onset heart disease and other chronic illnesses.&nbsp; It is time for us to reset priorities, traditions and outdated belief systems, and instead focus on helping current and future generations become healthier and happier.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Dr. Sinha works with large employee groups in Silicon Valley, helping South Asians, as well as those of many other ethnicities, to improve their health and reduce their risk factors while still respecting patients&#39; cultural dietary and lifestyle customs.

Many are familiar with the Claude glass as a small black convex mirror used by artists and spectators of landscape to reflect a view and make tonal values and areas of light and shade visible. In a groundbreaking account, Maillet goes well beyond this particular function of the glass and situates it within a richer archaeology of Western thought, exploring the uncertainties and anxieties about mirrors, reflections, and their potential distortions. He takes us from the magical and occult background of the "black mirror," through a full evaluation of its importance in the age of the picturesque, to its persistence in a range of technological and representational practices, including photography, film, and contemporary art. The Claude Glass is a lasting contribution to the history of Western visual culture.</p></p><p>Arnaud Maillet is an art historian who received his doctorate at the University of Paris I. <i>The Claude Glass</i> is his first book.<p>This sustained examination of an instrument so integral to the history of Romantic esthetics, and yet so neglected, is a valuable and important work.</p>&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><h2>Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels)</h2><p>A young Irish lawyer takes a seat in the Victorian House of Commons</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

He finds answers by applying attachment theory in the tradition of Bowlby and Ainsworth, and object relations theory in the tradition of Klein, Jacobson, Mahler, and Kernberg, to case studies of bizarre and unusual homicides. These idiographic portraits illustrate erotomanic delusional disorder, chronic catathymia, the psychopath as love object, and assassination as a form of pathological attachment. He elucidates the ways in which certain psychodynamics that inexorably move toward murder can only exist within a fixated or regressed preoedipal personality structure. Such individuals are organized at a borderline or psychotic level, and most often utilize defenses of projection, projective identification, and omnipotent control. This book is written for psychotherapists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, and social workers in clinical or forensic practice. Biological foci include concepts about the deep limbic structures of the brain and the biochemistry that inhibits or disinhibits such violence. Psychological patterns include both psychoanalytic constructs and the specific psychological test data from the case studies that support such constructs. Social factors include the behavior of the victim and, in the case of assassination, the political acts that contribute to predatory violence. Dr. Meloy emphasizes the crucial need for mental health professionals to go beyond descriptive diagnoses and find the motivation and meaning of such acts. Theprofessional&#39;s causal and purposive formulations about such violent attachments lead to more effective evaluation, treatment, and intervention, and perhaps testimony in subsequent criminal and civil litigation.</p><h2>The Only Three Questions That Count: Investing by Knowing What Others Don&#39;t</h2><p><i>The Only Three Questions That Count</i> is the first book to show you how to think about investing for yourself and develop innovative ways to understand and profit from the markets.

To the uninitiated, there is a strange, alluring mystique to the art of Finnish sauna. But to an ever-increasing number of people-from their small urban saunas to backwoods and lakeside retreats-the culture and practice of Finnish sauna are as much a part of northwoods life as campfires and canoe trips.<br>Beginning with the origins of Finnish sauna and how the practice was first brought to North America, and continuing all the way to contemporary design, <i>The Opposite of Cold</i> is an exquisite commemoration of the history, culture, and practice of Finnish sauna in the northwoods. With stunning photographs of unique and historic saunas of the region-including the oldest sauna in North America, incredible surviving saunas from immigrant farmsteads, and the gorgeous contemporary saunas from noted architects-Michael Nordskog and Aaron Hautala unveil the importance and beauty of sauna culture in modern Midwestern life.<br>Richly illuminated by Aaron Hautala's photographs of distinctive saunas from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario, and Finland, <i>The Opposite of Cold</i> is for people who grew up with Wednesday and Saturday evening saunas (or watched their steaming neighbors running toward the lake) and for those who dream of one day having their own. And through this book we see why Finnish sauna tradition is vital and enduring, from the warmest summer evenings to the coldest winter nights.</p><p>Michael Nordskog is an attorney, editor, and writer who grew up in Two Harbors, Minnesota. His writing has appeared in numerous publications including <i>The Rake and Lake County Journal</i>, and he is a former contributor to <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>.<br>Aaron Hautala is the creative director and owner of RedHouseMedia in Brainerd, Minnesota. He has helped launch a variety of magazines and was the founding art director at <i>Lake Country Journal</i>. His photographs have appeared widely throughout Minnesota.<br>David Salmela is an award-winning architect practicing out of Duluth, Minnesota. Considered one of America's leading practitioners of critical regionalism, his contemporary sauna designs are highly recognized.<br>Arnold Alanen is professor emeritus of landscape architecture at the University of Wisconsin and the author of <i>Morgan Park: Duluth, U.S. Steel, and the Forging of a Company Town</i> (Minnesota, 2007).<p>"The Finnish sauna is often a modest structure, made of wood and stone. Over time the wood rots, the stones crack, and finally all that is left are memories. But what memories! I can&#x2019;t think of any human activity except eating that brings people together with such wholeness. Mind, body, and spirit are fused by the heat and steam, and we are collectively reminded of all the things that make us uniquely human. Author Michael Nordskog and photographer Aaron W. Hautala have created a fitting tribute to the great sauna tradition of northern Minnesota. <i>The Opposite of Cold</i> makes permanent the fleeting memories of the early Finnish immigrants and the generations that followed. This is an important work and it honors everything it touches." &#x2014;Mikkel Aaland, author of <i>Sweat</i></p><br><br><p>"This beautifully illustrated guide to the saunas of not only Minnesota but also Wisconsin, Michigan, Ontario and Finland celebrates a very old tradition while revealing its importance to modern Midwestern culture. . . . It&#x2019;s a lovely tribute to North America&#x2019;s &#x2018;sauna belt.&#x2019;" &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><br><br><p>"This lovely, intelligent book examines sauna tradition in the United States (primarily in the regions around Lake Superior) as well as in Finland.

Remarkable for his range of thought and his mastery of treatment, Archimedes addressed such topics as the famous problems of the ratio of the areas of a cylinder and an inscribed sphere; the measurement of a circle; the properties of conoids, spheroids, and spirals; and the quadrature of the parabola. This edition offers an informative introduction with many valuable insights into the ancient mathematician&#39;s life and thought as well as the views of his contemporaries. Modern mathematicians, physicists, science historians, and logicians will find this volume a source of timeless fascination.</p><p></p><h2>Mathematics Form and Function</h2><p>This book records my efforts over the past four years to capture in words a description of the form and function of Mathematics, as a background for the Philosophy of Mathematics. My efforts have been encouraged by lec� tures that I have given at Heidelberg under the auspices of the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung, at the University of Chicago, and at the University of Minnesota, the latter under the auspices of the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications. Jean Benabou has carefully read the entire manuscript and has offered incisive comments. George Glauberman, Car� los Kenig, Christopher Mulvey, R. Narasimhan, and Dieter Puppe have provided similar comments on chosen chapters. Fred Linton has pointed out places requiring a more exact choice of wording. Many conversations with George Mackey have given me important insights on the nature of Mathematics. I have had similar help from Alfred Aeppli, John Gray, Jay Goldman, Peter Johnstone, Bill Lawvere, and Roger Lyndon. Over the years, I have profited from discussions of general issues with my colleagues Felix Browder and Melvin Rothenberg. Ideas from Tammo Tom Dieck, Albrecht Dold, Richard Lashof, and Ib Madsen have assisted in my study of geometry. Jerry Bona and B. L. Foster have helped with my examina� tion of mechanics. My observations about logic have been subject to con� structive scrutiny by Gert Miiller, Marian Boykan Pour-El, Ted Slaman, R. Voreadou, Volker Weispfennig, and Hugh Woodin.</p><p></p><h2>Trade Like a Hedge Fund: 20 Successful Uncorrelated Strategies and Techniques to Winning Profits</h2><p>Learn the successful strategies behind hedge fund investing <p>Hedge funds and hedge fund trading strategies have long been popular in the financial community because of their flexibility, aggressiveness, and creativity.

This book shares 20 uncorrelated trading strategies and techniques that will enable readers to trade and invest like never before. With detailed examples and up-to-the-minute trading advice, Trade Like a Hedge Fund is a unique book that will help readers increase the value of their portfolios, while decreasing risk.</p> <p>James Altucher (New York, NY) is a partner at Subway Capital, a hedge fund focused on special arbitrage situations, and short-term statistically based strategies.

But it's not the hedge fund managers doing the talking. These secretive financial pros, while relentlessly pursuing every possible angle to provide their clients with far-better-than-average returns, are just as relentless in revealing as little as possible about the techniques they use to achieve those returns. <p>Trade Like a Hedge Fund changes all that. Written by hedge fund manager James Altucher, this technique-heavy introduction to the day-in, day-out world of hedge fund trading explores twenty trading systems, strategies, and techniques that active traders can use to uncover hidden pockets of inefficiency in any market. Altucher is well known to hedge fund managers and other market professionals for his regular contributions to TheStreet.com, and he wastes no time in getting right to the bread-and-butter trading strategies that form the foundation of today's well-documented hedge fund successes.</p> <p>Learn the tips and techniques that allow fund managers and frontline traders to: </p> <ul> <li>Identify stocks that are gapping up or down, then trade those with the greatest short-term likelihood of filling that gap</li> <li>Intraday trade the NYSE tick indicator-perhaps the purest indicator of investor sentiment at any given second</li> <li>Provide impressive short-term trading profits using an innovative Bollinger Band--based trading system</li> <li>Buy a portfolio of less-than-five-dollar stocks-and average over 100 percent annual return</li> <li>Follow the low-profile movements of fixed-income investors for valuable clues to equity market direction</li> <li>Profit from playing stocks on the verge of being deleted-not added, but deleted-from major indices</li> <li>Profit from trading against common market fallacies that continually win praise even as they are continually proven wrong</li> </ul> <p>Despite evidence to the contrary, hedge fund managers and traders are not magicians. But they are distinctive and savvy traders who-as opposed to staid, rules-driven mutual fund or portfolio managers-enjoy the freedom to employ virtually any strategy in search of trading profits for their high-wealth clients. Let Trade Like a Hedge Fund give you a rare first-person look inside the world of the hedge fund manager, and introduce you to numerous hedge-fund techniques and tactics that you can seamlessly-and profitably-integrate into your own trading program.</p>Praise for Trade Like a Hedge Fund <p>"If you want factual advice based on real research, this is a must-read."<br> &#x2013;Larry Williams, author, The Right Stock at the Right Time</p> <p>"Altucher, a successful money manager, reveals his most profitable stock trading strategies and how to use them, despite strong protests from his partners and clients.

Curious, measured, contemplative yet not unworldly, witty, free of prejudice, and urbane. But what does Montaigne have to tell us about how to think and live today? In forty short, erudite and lively chapters written over a single summer, Antoine Compagnon seeks answers to that question. <br><br></p><p>In <i>A Summer with Montaigne</i>, Compagnon invites his readers to join him as he strolls through Montaigne&#x2019;s key contributions to our understanding of what is good and worthwhile in life. This engaging book, then, serves as both an introduction to Montaigne for readers unfamiliar with his work and a refresher for those who are already acquainted with his unique brilliance, vitality, and timeliness. Montaigne&#x2019;s <i>Essays</i> deal with themes that remain relevant today, from the problems posed by religion, war, power and friendship to the absurdity of our fixations and peccadillos. As accompanies readers through the <i>Essays</i>, Compagnon never pontificates and is never austere, rather he approaches Montaigne with a sense of humor, admiration, and joy.</p></p><p><p><b>Antoine Compagnon</b> is a Professor of French Literature at Coll�ge de France, Paris, and the Blanche W.

Using major new documentary sources, including cables and letters between Mao Zedong and Stalin, and interviews with key Russian, Chinese, and Korean participants, the book focuses on the domestic and foreign policy decision-making in all three countries from 1945 through October 1950. The authors examine the complex relations between Stalin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Mao during the last year of the Chinese civil war and the emergence of the Cold War. They show how the interplay of perceptions, national security policies, and personalities shaped those relations and were used by the North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to win backing for the invasion of South Korea. The authors also examine the Sino-Soviet alliance, drawing on hitherto unknown secret protocols and understandings and the records of high-level planning that led to the invasion and to the Chinese intervention in Korea.

By some reports they are &#x201c;runaway,&#x201d; out-of-control &#x201c;predators&#x201d; that &#x201c;feed&#x201d; on galaxies, only to &#x201c;belch&#x201d; and &#x201c;spit out&#x201d; what they don&#x2019;t eat. They &#x201c;lurk&#x201d; in the shadows, &#x201c;mangling&#x201d; stars and &#x201c;gobbling&#x201d; them up. In short, they have a nasty reputation for being monsters &#x201c;gone mad.&#x201d;<br><br>But you know what?<br><br>A black hole isn&#x2019;t a monster. It&#x2019;s not even alive. That means it can&#x2019;t lurk, eat, or belch. It has no dark, de-structive desires.<br><br>Of course, you may have already figured this out. But you know what else?<br><br>A black hole is NOT a hole&#x2014;at least not the kind you can dig in the groundor poke your finger through. You can&#x2019;t just walk along and fall into one.A black hole isn&#x2019;t a hole&nbsp;like that.<br><br>If a black hole is not a hole, then what in the universe is it?<br><br><b>1. Places with Pull</b><br><i>A black hole is a place in space with&nbsp;a powerful pull.</i><br><br>Way out beyond where you are right now, beyond the clouds, beyond the Moon, beyond Pluto, beyond our solar system, space goes on and on. You could travel for trillions of miles and you&#x2019;d barely get to the closest star. In another few trillion miles you might pass an-other star. Space is that huge.<br><br>Way out there, trillions, quadrillions, and even more -illions of miles away, are special places called black holes. These places in space are special because of their powerful pull on other things. A black hole&#x2019;s pull is the strongest pull in the entire universe.<br><br>Nothing can out-tug a black hole. No army of tow trucks, no convoy of supersized earth haulers, no fleet of giant rocket engines. Not all of them combined.<br><br>A black hole pulls in nearby dust. It pulls in nearby asteroids. It pulls in nearby stars and even nearby starlight. And no light, stars, asteroids, or dust comes out. Not ever.<br><br><i>How Far Out Is Way Out There?</i><br><br>Black holes are way out beyond where you are right now&#x2014;much farther away than the edge of our solar system. To talk about the distance to a black hole, you&#x2019;d need a huge number.&nbsp;<br><br>How huge? Well, in your everyday life, you probably travel only a few miles (or kilometers). At most, you might go tens of miles. Longer trips might be in the hundreds or even thousands of miles. In outer space, these distances would seem smaller than baby steps. Out there, you&#x2019;d need to stock up on zeroes to describe how far it is from one place to another.<br><br>From Earth to the Sun: millions of miles or kilometers<br>From the Sun to the next closest star: tens of trillions of miles or kilometers<br>From Earth to the nearest black hole: tens of quadrillions of miles or kilometers<br><br>Distance across our galaxy (Milky Way): hundreds of quadrillions of miles or kilometers<br><br>Distance across the observable universe (which may be much smaller&nbsp;than the whole universe): sextillions of miles or kilometers<br><br>In the universe, enormous distances separate even&#x201c;close&#x201d; neighbors. The Sun and Pluto, for instance, are a staggering 3,647,240,000 miles (5,869,660,000 kilometers) apart&#x2014;yet that&#x2019;s just a hop, skip, and jump, astronomically speaking!(Sizes and distances in this diagram are not to scale.)</p><h2>The Sociology of Education: A Systematic Analysis</h2><p><p>The Sociology of Education: A Systematic Analysis is a comprehensive and cross-cultural look at the sociology of education.

He is also an advisor to Granada Studios&#x2019; Sherlock Holmes museum, and he contributed commentaries to the DVD releases of the Basil Rathbone Holmes films.<b>Chapter I - An Inspector Calls</b>It has often been said - indeed, I have been one of those who have said it - that Sherlock Holmes, the famous consulting detective, was <i>the</i> champion of law and order of his age. However, on reflection, I can state that this is only partly true. Crime did indeed fascinate Holmes, but when it came to the solving of it, he was very selective. I have been present when he has rejected numerous pleas and entreaties to tackle a particular mystery solely on the basis that it was simply not interesting enough. The misdemeanours that intrigued my capricious friend had to bear the hallmark of the <i>recherch�</i> before he would contemplate involving himself in providing a solution. He loved detective work for its own sake, but the detective work had to pose an unusual conundrum or it presented no challenge.So it was in the spring of 1896 when, after a very fallow period, he devoured news of criminal activity reported in the daily press in the hope of spotting some intriguing puzzle to satisfy his needs. I would aid him every morning in this pursuit by pointing out what I regarded to be crimes of intellectual interest.&#x201c;What you may consider stimulating to the deductive brain, Watson, falls far short of my ideal,&#x201d; he would comment disparagingly. &#x201c;Music hall artiste strangled in dressing room poses no cerebral challenge whatsoever. A case of jealousy and intoxication. No doubt even the Scotland Yarders could cope with that one in a day!&#x201d;&#x201c;Have you seen the report in the<i> Chronicle</i> of the murder of Sir George Faversham, the noted archaeologist?&#x201d;Holmes took his pipe from his mouth and paused. &#x201c;Items stolen from the family home?&#x201d;&#x201c;Nothing of real value taken.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he scoffed. &#x201c;Common burglary with homicidal consequences.&#x201d;I threw down the paper. &#x201c;I give up,&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;There is obviously nothing that will satisfy you.&#x201d;Holmes gave me a weak grin. &#x201c;Well, at least we are agreed on that point.&#x201d; His eyes wandered to the drawer in his bureau where I knew he still kept the neat Morocco case containing the hypodermic syringe.&#x201c;And that is not the answer either,&#x201d; I snapped.For a moment Holmes looked surprised, and then a dreamy smile touched his countenance. He realised that I was playing him at his own game by reading his thoughts. The idea amused him so much that he burst out with a roar of laughter. His hilarity was so contagious that soon I was laughing along with him. So enwrapped were we in our own amusement that we failed to take notice of the insistent knock at our sitting room door. Moments later, it opened hesitantly and Inspector Hardcastle of the Yard stood on our threshold. Holmes had worked with Hardcastle on a couple of investigations in the past, notably the disappearing Chinese laundry affair. He was a dour Yorkshireman who was methodical and thorough, rather than inspired, in his police work. He appeared most discomfited by our abandoned behaviour.&#x201c;If I have called at an inconvenient moment, gentlemen...&#x201d; he said, bristling somewhat, unsure whether he was the cause of our amusement.&#x201c;Not at all, Hardcastle,&#x201d; cried my friend, still chortling. &#x201c;It is always a pleasure to receive a visit from one of my friends in the official force.&#x201d; He waved the Scotland Yarder to a chair. &#x201c;Sit down, my dear fellow, and don't look so disheartened. Weeks of inactivity have lightened my brain. You are indeed a sight for sore eyes, especially if you have a case for us.&#x201d;The inspector, uncertainly still clouding his features, did as he was bidden. He was a tall, beefy man whose great oval face was beset with large, grey, mournful eyes and a broken nose. His black hair, plastered with cream, looked as though it had just dropped on his head. Clutching his bowler tightly in his large hands, he sat awkwardly in the chair opposite us.&#x201c;You <i>do</i> have a case for us?&#x201d; enquired Holmes languidly, his mood changing rapidly.&#x201c;Something I though might interest you,&#x201d; said Hardcastle, his equilibrium still not restored.&#x201c;I hope it's not something already reported in the papers,&#x201d; observed Holmes, relighting his pipe with a glowing cinder from the fire. &#x201c;It's not the strangled magician at Henty's Music Hall?'&#x201c;It most certainly is not,&#x201d; snapped Hardcastle indignantly. &#x201c;Young Kingsley is on that case. I put my money on Roland Reilly, the 'Irish Vagabond with a Voice of Gold'.&#x201d;&#x201c;I am sure you are right. I have heard that when in drink he was a towering rage. In the confined world of the music hall artiste, the smallest slights and petty jealousy become magnified beyond all reason. I wonder that there isn't a blood bath every night.&#x201d;Hardcastle looked curiously at my friend, striving to ascertain whether Holmes was being serious or still gently teasing him.&#x201c;Come, come,&#x201d; said Holmes, spinning his hand as a conductor might to increase the speed of the music, &#x201c;let us hear about your case, Hardcastle.&#x201d;&#x201c;There has been a break-in at the British Museum.&#x201d;&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d; groaned Holmes, slumping back in the chair.&#x201c;There's more to it than that.&#x201d;&#x201c;There had better be. What was stolen: some mediaeval pottery, or some gewgaws belonging to Henry VIII, perhaps?&#x201d;&#x201c;I'll come to that in a moment. It was a very professional job. A two man operation.&#x201d;&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;The Inspector's face lit up. &#x201c;Because they were foolish enough to leave clues behind, Mr Holmes. We found two sets of muddy footprints near the scene of the crime and, before you ask, they could not have been anyone else's because the floor is mopped clean after closing time.&#x201d;Holmes held his hands in mock surrender. &#x201c;Two men it is then, Hardcastle.&#x201d;&#x201c;The crib-cracker and the expert, I should guess.&#x201d;&#x201c;Expert?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;Yes, Doctor Watson. Whoever it was knew exactly what he wanted. He had the whole ruddy museum to go at and just the one thing was taken.&#x201d;Holmes leaned forward a little, interested now. &#x201c;What was that one thing?&#x201d;&#x201c;Some papyrus document - a scroll, I think.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah, from the Egyptology room.&#x201d;&#x201c;That's right. Full of those old mummies and dog-headed statues and the like.&#x201d;&#x201c;And,&#x201d; said Holmes &#x201c;various gold trinkets and other very precious <i>objets d'art</i> which would have been far easier and more profitable to dispose of than a crumbling old document.&#x201d;&#x201c;Precisely, Mr. Holmes.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, Watson, what does this suggest to you?&#x201d;&#x201c;A collector. The item to be added to his private collection, for his own personal viewing.&#x201d;My friend beamed. &#x201c;A very determined collector.&#x201d;&#x201c;More determined than you'd think,&#x201d; said Hardcastle. &#x201c;Determined enough to kill for the booty.&#x201d;&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;&#x201c;The night security guard.&#x201d;&#x201c;How?&#x201d;&#x201c;Shot in the head at point blank range.&#x201d;&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;&#x201c;With a Derringer pistol.&#x201d;&#x201c;How can you be so sure?&#x201d; I asked.In answer, Hardcastle fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a dark velvet bag fastened with a draw-string at the top. Opening the bag, he allowed the contents to slip onto the small table by Holmes. It was a small silver Derringer pistol which sparkled in the firelight. &#x201c;The murderer dropped it while making his escape.&#x201d;&#x201c;Careless of him,&#x201d; said Holmes, taking a long-stemmed clay pipe from the rack on the mantelpiece. Slipping the stem through the trigger guard, he lifted up the pistol to examine it. &#x201c;An expensive weapon... chased silver... a recent purchase...&#x201d; He murmured these comments more to himself than to us.&#x201c;I remembered about your own system for checking fingerprints, Mr. Holmes, Mr Holmes,&#x201d; said Hardcastle eagerly. &#x201c;That's how you managed to lay a trap for Fu Wong, but I reckon you won't find any on that gun.&#x201d;&#x201c;Of course not. This fellow would have worn gloves.&#x201d; He sniffed the weapon, which had a finely-tooled brown leather grip, and then examined the barrel. &#x201c;Fired just the once. Not the kind of firearm usually associated with burglary and the class of crib-crackers we've encountered before, eh, Watson?&#x201d;&#x201c;It's a ladies' gun,&#x201d; I sniffed.&#x201c;But it does a man's job.&#x201d; Holmes took it over to the window and, retrieving his lens from the bureau, scrutinised the Derringer closely. At length he returned to his chair. Slipping the pistol into the velvet bag, he handed it back to the inspector.&#x201c;Anything, Mr. Holmes?&#x201d;Holmes pursed his lips and shook his head. &#x201c;Very little. The owner is youngish man with blond hair, has expensive tastes, is somewhat extravagant in nature, is arrogant, and extremely confident. And he is probably mentally unstable.&#x201d;The inspector's eyes widened. &#x201c;How on earth do you reach those conclusions?&#x201d;&#x201c;A fine blond hair caught in the trigger guard gives me the colouring and the age, and there is the faint aroma of gentlemen's <i>eau de toilette</i> still lingering about the leather grip. The owner obviously handled the weapon while his fingers were still moist with the perfume and it has soaked into the crevices of the tooled leather. For so persistent an aroma to remain, this particular fragrance could not have been purchased for less than fifty shillings a bottle, which indicates both the expensive taste and the extravagant nature. The fact that there was only one bullet in the gun suggests our young villain was supremely confident that only one bullet was required for the deed. That smacks of remarkable arrogance also. The probability that this fellow adorned himself with expensive <i>eau de toilette</i> before going out to commit a horrid crime implies that he views murder almost as a social event - which suggests to me a certain element of mental instability.&#x201d;&#x201c;Extraordinary,&#x201d; murmured Hardcastle. I was unsure whether he was referring to Holmes's ability to fill in so many details about the murderer from a brief examination of his gun or to the character of the killer as my friend had described him.&#x201c;Those few details may be of assistance as the case progresses, but at present they do not get us very far. I suspect that the real help will come from discovering more about the nature of the item that was stolen.&#x201d;Hardcastle appeared unconvinced. &#x201c;As I said, Mr. Holmes: it was just some old papyrus document covered with ancient writing.&#x201d;&#x201c;Hieroglyphics,&#x201d; I said.The policeman's face crumpled with distaste. &#x201c;So I gather, Doctor. I must admit I'm much more at home with the theft of a plate, stolen gems, or a straightforward shoot 'em or stab 'em murder case.&#x201d;Holmes's eyes sparkled mischievously. &#x201c;And it has taken you approximately forty-eight hours to discover that you are out of your depth in the matter. Ah, don't deny it, Inspector. The deterioration of the cordite in the gun-barrel tells me that it is some two or three days since it was fired; and, quite honestly, old chap, the depth of the furrows on your brow speaks of a weary problem, one that has been with you for several days and not one that has been thrust upon you overnight. It is Monday morning now. I should estimate that the robbery took place on Friday night. Am I correct?&#x201d;Hardcastle nodded dumbly.&#x201c;But there has been no mention in the press of the crime,&#x201d; said I.&#x201c;We managed to keep it out of the papers,&#x201d; Hardcastle replied. &#x201c;We needed the time to check up on the various dealers who handle this kind of specialised merchandise before the press got wind of it.&#x201d;&#x201c;'Dusty' Robinson and his ilk?'The inspector nodded. &#x201c;That's right, Mr. Holmes. We followed up all the known leads both in and out of the Rogues' Gallery, but we hit a brick wall with all of 'em.&#x201d;&#x201c;How valuable is this document?&#x201d; I asked.Hardcastle shrugged. &#x201c;They can't really put a price on it. To you or me, Doctor, it would be pretty worthless, but to a connoisseur of these kinds of things, it's priceless.&#x201d; Suddenly the policeman strained forward, his face twisting into a pained grimace as though he were suffering from acute toothache. &#x201c;To be honest with you, this is beyond me, Mr. Holmes.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

The authors present the latest practices and techniques of Responsibility-Driven Design and show how you can apply them as you develop modern object-based applications.</p> <p>Working within this conceptual framework, Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and Alan McKean present how user requirements, system architecture, and design patterns all contribute to the design of an effective object model. They introduce a rich vocabulary that designers can use to discuss aspects of their designs, discuss design trade-offs, and offer practical guidelines for enhancing the reliability and flexibility of applications. In addition, case studies and real-world examples demonstrate how the principles and techniques of Responsibility-Driven Design apply to real-world software designs.</p> <p>You'll find coverage of such topics as:</p> <li>Strategies for selecting and rejecting candidate objects in an emerging design model</li> <li>Object role stereotypes and how to identify objects' behaviors</li> <li>How to characterize objects using role stereotypes</li> <li>Allocating responsibilities to appropriate objects</li> <li>Developing a collaboration model</li> <li>Strategies for designing application control centers</li> <li>Documenting and describing a design, focusing on use cases, design conversations, and annotations</li> <li>Strategies for enhancing reliability, including handling exceptions and recovering from errors</li> <li>How to characterize software variations and design to support them for greater flexibility</li> <li>How to categorize and treat various kinds of design problems</li> <p>As all experienced designers know, software design is part art and inspiration and part consistent effort and solid technique. <b> <i>Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations</i> </b> will help all software designers--from students to seasoned professionals--develop both the concrete reasoning skills and the design expertise necessary to produce responsible software designs.</p> <br> <br> 0201379430B08292002<p> <b>Rebecca Wirfs-Brock</b> is founder of Wirfs-Brock Associates.

Since the death of his father, Taro keeps to himself, but is soon drawn into an unusual relationship with the woman upstairs, Nishi, as she passes on the strange tale of the sky-blue house next door.<br><br>First discovered by Nishi in the little-known photo-book 'Spring Garden', the sky-blue house soon becomes a focus for both Nishi and Taro: of what is lost, of what has been destroyed, and of what hope may yet lie in the future for both of them, if only they can seize it.</p><p>Tomoka Shibasaki was born in 1973 in Osaka and began writing fiction while still in high school. After graduating from university, she took an office job but continued writing, and was shortlisted for the Bungei Prize in 1998. Her first book, <i>A Day on the Planet</i>, was turned into a hit movie, and <i>Spring Garden</i> won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize in 2014.The woman was looking at something over her firstfloor<br> balcony, her hands gripping the railing, her neck<br> craned forward.<br> From the ground floor, Taro watched the woman. She<br> did not move. The sunlight that reflected off her blackframed<br> glasses meant that Taro couldn&#x2019;t tell which direction<br> she was looking, but she was faced straight ahead,<br> towards the concrete wall and, beyond it, the house of<br> Mrs Saeki, who owned the flats.<br> It was a block of flats shaped like an L flipped and<br> rotated so that the short section was hanging down. Taro&#x2019;s<br> flat was in the short section. The woman on the balcony<br> was at the far end of the long section, the flat farthest<br> away from his. He had happened to catch sight of her<br> as he went to shut the small window looking out onto<br> the courtyard&#x2014;although courtyard was really too grand<br> a word for that space, three metres wide with weeds<br> growing in the gaps between the paving stones, and to<br> top it all, a sign that read no entry. With the arrival of<br> spring, the concrete wall separating the flats from Mrs<br> Saeki&#x2019;s house had suddenly become thick with ivy. The<br> two trees growing immediately behind the wall, a maple<br> and a plum, had been left untended, and their branches<br> now stretched over it. Behind the trees was the two-storey<br> wooden house belonging to Mrs Saeki which, to go by its<br> appearance, must have been pretty old. As usual, there<br> were no signs of anyone at home.<br> The woman hadn&#x2019;t moved an inch. From where Taro<br> stood, he could see only the concrete wall and the roof<br> of Mrs Saeki&#x2019;s house, but he assumed that from the first<br> floor the woman could probably see down to the ground<br> level of the house and its garden. Still, what could have<br> been so fascinating about a view like that? The most<br> striking thing about the house&#x2019;s red corrugated iron roof<br> and its dark brown wooden walls was the extent of their<br> wear and tear. It was now a year since Mrs Saeki, who&#x2019;d<br> been living on her own, had moved into a care home for<br> seniors. She&#x2019;d looked spritely enough whenever Taro saw<br> her sweeping the front of her house, but apparently she<br> was about to turn eighty-six. All this Taro had learnt from<br> the estate agent.<br> Beyond the roof of Mrs Saeki&#x2019;s house, Taro could see<br> the sky. It had been perfectly clear when he woke up, but<br> now there were a few clouds&#x2014;bright white lumps, the sort<br> that usually appeared in midsummer, although it was<br> only May. Looking at the tops of the clouds that bulged<br> right up and towered above the rest, he thought about<br> how they actually had to be several kilometres above the<br> earth. The contrast between them and the deep blue of<br> the sky was so strong it hurt his eyes.<br> Taro imagined himself standing on a cloud. This was<br> something he did often. After walking for miles, he would<br> reach the cloud&#x2019;s edge. Grasping the edge, he would look<br> down at the city thousands of metres below. He could see<br> the narrow little roads intertwined, the roofs of houses<br> clustered together. Cars the size of insects zipped along<br> the streets. Small aeroplanes cut across the space between<br> the city and the cloud. For some reason, in this vision of<br> Taro&#x2019;s, the planes alone were cartoon drawings, nothing<br> else. Behind their glass-fronted noses, the cockpits were<br> empty. The planes made no sound. In fact, it wasn&#x2019;t just<br> the planes that were silent&#x2014;there was no noise of any<br> kind anywhere. As Taro stood up slowly, he bumped his<br> head up against the top of the sky. There was nobody<br> else around.<br> Taro had been picturing this exact same sequence of<br> events ever since he was a child. After it ran its course<br> this time, he looked towards the balcony at the far end<br> of the first floor and noticed that, all of a sudden, the<br> scene contained a white square. Looking more closely,<br> he saw that the woman had propped a piece of drawing<br> paper&#x2014;no, it was a sketchpad&#x2014;on top of the railing. Was<br> she drawing the trees, or what? The balcony was southfacing,<br> and the building did not have much in the way of<br> eaves. It was two o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. Surely too bright<br> for sketching.<br> From time to time, the woman would lean her body<br> forward to get a better view of whatever she was drawing,<br> and Taro would get a glimpse of her face. She had shortish<br> hair in no particular style&#x2014;a fringed bob, at a stretch. Taro<br> had seen her around after she moved into the block in<br> February, and he guessed she was in her thirties, about<br> the same age as he was, maybe younger. She was short,<br> and seemingly always dressed in a T-shirt and jogging<br> bottoms. All of a sudden, the woman lifted her neck, and<br> her head turned in Taro&#x2019;s direction. Taro realized then that<br> it wasn&#x2019;t Mrs Saeki&#x2019;s house that the woman was looking<br> at. It was the one next to it, on the side of Taro&#x2019;s flat: the<br> sky-blue house.<br> Right then, the sharp whistle of a bird pierced the air,<br> and there was a rustle of leaves. In the next instant, Taro&#x2019;s<br> and the woman&#x2019;s eyes met. Before he had time to look<br> away, she had disappeared, taking her sketchpad with<br> her. He heard the door to her balcony sliding shut. She<br> didn&#x2019;t come out again.</p><h2>Shopping for Bombs: Nuclear Proliferation, Global Insecurity, and the Rise and Fall of the A.Q. Khan Network</h2><p>A.Q. Khan was the world's leading black market dealer in nuclear technology, described by a former CIA Director as "at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden." A hero in Pakistan and revered as the Father of the Bomb, Khan built a global clandestine network that sold the most closely guarded nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea, and Libya. <br><br>Here for the first time is the riveting inside story of the rise and fall of A.Q. Khan and his role in the devastating spread of nuclear technology over the last thirty years. Drawing on exclusive interviews with key players in Islamabad, London, and Washington, as well as with members of Khan's own network, BBC journalist Gordon Corera paints a truly unsettling picture of the ultimate arms bazaar. Corera reveals how Khan operated within a world of shadowy deals among rogue states and how his privileged position in Pakistan provided him with the protection to build his unique and deadly business empire. It explains why and how he was able to operate so freely for so many years. Brimming with revelations, the book provides new insight into Iran's nuclear ambitions and how close Tehran may be to the bomb. <br><br>In addition, the book contains startling new information on how the CIA and MI6 penetrated Khan's network, how the U.S. and UK ultimately broke Khan's ring, and how they persuaded Pakistan's President Musharraf to arrest a national hero. The book also provides the first detailed account of the high-wire dealings with Muammar Gadaffi, which led to Libya's renunciation of nuclear weapons and which played a key role in Khan's downfall.<br><br>The spread of nuclear weapons technology around the globe presents the greatest security challenge of our time. Shopping for Bombs presents a unique window into the challenges of stopping a new nuclear arms race, a race that A.Q. Khan himself did more than any other individual to promote.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gordon Corera</strong> is a Security Correspondent for BBC News. He covers counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, and international security issues for BBC TV, Radio, and Online. He has writen extensively on the British and American intelligence community and has worked as a foreign affairs reporter for Britain's Today show. He was educated at Oxford and Harvard Universities and joined the BBC in 1997.<br><br>"It is tempting to demonize A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani engineer who became infamous for selling nuclear weapons designs and production equipment to North Korea, Iran, Libya and perhaps others. If Khan is written off as simply evil, then his deeds can be written off as peculiar sins that do not reflect flaws in the international system. Unfortunately, life is more complicated, as the BBC reporter Gordon Corera vividly narrates in his fine new book. <em>Shopping for Bombs</em> is more than the fast-paced story of an alarming proliferation network and the conditions that let it flourish. Corera also offers a fascinating, detailed account of how Libya surprised the world with its undetected nuclear acquisitions and how the United States and Britain secretly persuaded Moammar Gaddafi to verifiably give them up. Corera takes readers briskly through real policy conundrums without lapsing into wonk talk."--George Perkovich, <em>Washington Post Book World<p></p></em><br>"A measured account of how a young Pakistani metallurgist became the world's leading dealer in nuclear technology. Drawing on CIA and diplomatic accounts of the spread of technology, Corera examines why the Americans initially looked the other way as Pakistan joined forces in arming the mujahideen in Afghanistan before becoming an ally in the hunt for bin Laden."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A page-turner."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"<em>Shopping for Bombs</em> tells a disturbing tale.... From the 1970s through the 1990s, Khan secretly disseminated nuclear technology to a number of rogue states around the world. The full story of Khan's activities cannot yet be fully told--much information is under lock and key in Pakistan, if it has been preserved at all--but a persuasive preliminary account has been prepared by Gordon Corera."--<em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Gordon Corera has written a book you will not be able to put down. It reads like a thriller, but it is true! He has done an impressive job in researching and describing the extraordinary threat we face from nuclear weapons falling into the hands of those who wish us harm."--Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Distinguished Service Professor, Harvard University and author of <em>The Power Game: A Washington Novel</em><p></p><br>"A superb account of how A.Q. Khan, the pioneer of nuclear black marketeering, exploited the forces of globalization and loopholes in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to provide what IAEA Secretary General, Mohamed El-Baradei, called the 'Wal-Mart of private sector proliferation'."--Graham Allison, Douglas Dillon Professor, J. F. K. School of Government, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Reads like a thriller. Corera's story, about one of the greatest threats to international security of which I am aware, is chilling and disturbing. As a former practitioner in the field, and one who has remained a close observer of issues related to nuclear proliferation, I found <em>Shopping for Bombs</em> a great read; it is detailed and well sourced, and full of useful insights. For anyone interested in understanding the character of the threat posed by nuclear proliferation today, it is essential reading."-Ambassador Robert L. Gallucci, Dean, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University<p></p><br>"Corera's book magnificently sheds light on the activities of A.Q. Khan and rogue regimes around the world. In today's world of heightened nuclear tensions, this invaluable expos� represents a must-read for both policymakers and the general public." --Steven Emerson, author of <em>American Jihad: The</em> <em>Terrorists Living Among Us</em><p></p><br>"<em>Shopping for Bombs</em> is a clearly written and fascinating account of one of the most important episodes in the history of weapons of mass destruction--Pakistan's illicit and successful effort to build nuclear weapons and then to spread nuclear materials across the globe, an effort spearheaded by the maverick scientist A.Q. Khan. Corera has produced an even handed and absorbing history of that important story."--Peter Bergen, fellow of the New America Foundation and author of <em>The Osama bin Laden I Know</em> and <em>Holy War, Inc.</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Core Concepts in Athletic Training and Therapy (Athletic Training Education)</h2><p><p><i>Core Concepts in Athletic Training and Therapy</i> provides a balanced introduction to the knowledge, skills, and clinical abilities that span the profession of athletic training.

Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s extraordinary career as a novelist ended abruptly and unhappily, but it began with one of the most brilliant first novels in the history of American literature. Published when its author was just twenty-three, <i>This Side of Paradise</i> is about the education of a youth, and to this universal story Fitzgerald brought the promise of everything that was new in the vigorous, restless America during the years following World War I. Amory Blaine&#x2013;egoistic, versatile, callow, and imaginative&#x2013;inhabits a book that is interwoven with songs, poems, playscripts, and questions and answers. His growth from self-absorption to sexual awareness and personhood is described by means of a continuous improvisatory energy and delight. Far from being distracting, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s formal inventiveness and verve only heighten our sense that the world being described is our own modern world. A profound coherence informs <i>This Side of Paradise</i>&#x2013;a coherence born of its author&#x2019;s uncanny ability to revel in the fragmented surfaces of human life while exploring and comprehending its serene depths.</p></p><p>Fitzgerald&#39;s first novel, reprinted in the handsome Everyman&#39;s Library series of literary classic, uses numerous formal experiments to tell the story of Amory Blaine, as he grows up during the crazy years following the First World War. It also contains a new introduction by Craig Raine that describes critical and popular reception of the book when it came out in 1920.F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text. This new edition brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald&#39;s original manuscript.</p><h2>Poems for the Millennium, Volume Three: The University of California Book of Romantic &amp; Postromantic Poetry</h2><p>The previous two volumes of this acclaimed anthology set forth a globally decentered revision of twentieth-century poetry from the perspective of its many avant-gardes. Now editors Jerome Rothenberg and Jeffrey C. Robinson bring a radically new interpretation to the poetry of the preceding century, viewing the work of the romantic and post-romantic poets as an international, collective, often utopian enterprise that became the foundation of experimental modernism. Global in its range, volume three gathers selections from the poetry and manifestos of canonical poets, as well as the work of lesser-known but equally radical poets. Defining romanticism as experimental and visionary, Rothenberg and Robinson feature prose poetry, verbal-visual experiments, and sound poetry, along with more familiar forms seen here as if for the first time. The anthology also explores romanticism outside the European orbit and includes ethnopoetic and archaeological works outside the literary mainstream. The range of volume three and its skewing of the traditional canon illuminate the process by which romantics and post- romantics challenged nineteenth-century orthodoxies and propelled poetry to the experiments of a later modernism and avant-gardism.</p><p>"It would be impossible to overstate the wonders of this masterpiece of radical humanism. Expansive erudition, fundamental sensitivity, passionate intelligence, concern, adventurousness, and love inform this volume's structure and its substance. Rothenberg and Robinson have dedicated this project to an intensification and expansion of the vital and vivacious contexts of the ongoing project of human thought. They present us not with the fixity of a canon but with the unfixity of our world. The brooding of Romanticism will continue to burst around us. This wide-ranging, decentering, global panoply is a work of genius&#x2015;the editors' and ours."&#x2015;Lyn Hejinian, author of <i>The Language of Inquiry</i><br><br>"Compendious, capacious, global in scope, this third volume of <i>Poems for the Millennium</i>&#x2015;as the editors put it, a 'prequel' to the two existing volumes&#x2015;is a treasure; its commentaries offer a severe delight."&#x2015;Esther Schor, author of <i>Emma Lazarus</i><br><br>"This volume of <i>Poems for the Millennium</i> is every bit as challenging, unsettling, and surprising as its predecessors. It provokes us to take a fresh look at the achievements of nineteenth-century poets and of modernists often assumed to have defined themselves mainly by refusing and rejecting what came before. We have much to learn from this book about the diversity of ways in which poetry has found forms for responding to the world of which it is a part."&#x2015;William Keach, author of <i>Arbitrary Power: Romanticism, Language, Politics</i><br><br>&#x201c;The romantic vision is one of extension and renewal&#x2015;of poetry's signifying capacity in the immediate, human realm and that of the spirit. This provocative third volume of <i>Poems for the Millennium</i> is itself an instance of that romantic vision, definitively reframing and expanding our understanding of the movement.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michael Palmer, author of <i>Company of Moths</i><br><br>"Modernism rejected romanticism in the way that one political party rejects another&#x2015;not because it is so different but because it wishes to win the same audience. This book demonstrates that the crucial thing that happened in modernism was that a door opened onto still another aspect of the immense cultural experiment that romanticism was&#x2015;or, as Rothenberg and Robinson might insist, that romanticisms were (are).To know the work so carefully, lovingly, and brilliantly assembled in this book is to know ourselves in a new and newly conscious way."&#x2015;Jack Foley, author of <i>The Dancer and the Dance: A Book of Distinctions</i><b>Jerome Rothenberg </b>is an internationally known poet and Professor Emeritus of Visual Arts and Literature at the University of California, San Diego. <b>Jeffrey C.

Ranging from 1835 to 1877, the semi-autobiographical tale traces the dissolution of the family's bonds and traditions in the face of a changing world, exploring not only the fate of an individual household but also the crisis of an entire social class.<br> With the 1901&nbsp;publication of <i>Buddenbrooks,</i> his first novel, 26-year-old Mann secured the basis for his literary reputation. The author's skillful combination of nineteenth-century realism with modernist elements provides an accurate reflection of Germany's widespread cultural pessimism in the wake of its rapid industrialization. In addition to its appeal as a sweeping saga of a family's dramatic reversal of fortunes, the book also offers a richly detailed exploration of thought-provoking moral and philosophical themes related to duty, self-expression, and appearance versus reality.</p><p>German writer Thomas Mann (1875&#x2013;1955) is the author of <i>The Magic Mountain, Death in Venice,</i> and other acclaimed novels and short stories, including <i>Buddenbrooks, </i>for which he received the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature. Appalled by the rise of Nazism, Mann fled Germany in 1933 and spent the rest of his life in self-imposed exile, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1944.</p><h2>The Emperor&#39;s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth</h2><p>Do antidepressants work? Of course&#x2014;everyone knows it. Like his colleagues, Irving Kirsch, a researcher and clinical psychologist, for years referred patients to psychiatrists to have their depression treated with drugs before deciding to investigate for himself just how effective the drugs actually were. Over the course of the past fifteen years, however, Kirsch&#x20ac;&#x2122;s research&#x2014;a thorough analysis of decades of Food and Drug Administration data&#x2014;has demonstrated that what everyone knew about antidepressants was wrong. Instead of treating depression with drugs, we&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve been treating it with suggestion.The Emperor&#x20ac;&#x2122;s New Drugs makes an overwhelming case that what had seemed a cornerstone of psychiatric treatment is little more than a faulty consensus. But Kirsch does more than just criticize: he offers a path society can follow so that we stop popping pills and start proper treatment for depression.</p><p><b>Irving Kirsch</b>, a native of New York City, is a professor of psychology at the University of Hull, United Kingdom, and professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut.

In eighteen essays prepared especially for this book, these authors cover the period from the early Christian church to the twentieth century, offering fresh appraisals of such encounters as the trial of Galileo, the formulation of the Newtonian worldview, the coming of Darwinism, and the ongoing controversies over &#x201c;scientific creationism.&#x201d; They explore not only the impact of religion on science, but also the influence of science and religion.<br><br>This landmark volume promises not only to silence the persistent rumors of war between Christianity and science, but also serve as the point of departure for new explorations of their relationship, Scholars and general readers alike will find it provocative and readable.<br><br></p><p><b>David C.

Finally, more than twenty years after Vandiver expressed that wish, publication of <i>Jefferson Davis, Unconquerable Heart</i> makes such an interpretive biography available.</p><p>Felicity Allen begins this monumental work with Davis's political imprisonment at the end of the Civil War and masterfully flashes back to his earlier life, interweaving Davis's private life as a schoolboy, a Mississippi planter, a husband, a father, and a political leader. She follows him from West Point through army service on the frontier, his election to the U.S. House of Representatives, his regimental command in the Mexican War, his service as U.S. secretary of war and senator, and his term as president of the Confederate States of America.</p><p>Although Davis's family is the nexus of this biography, friends and enemies also play major roles. Among his friends intimately met in this book are such stellar figures as Andrew Jackson, John C. Calhoun, Zachary Taylor, Franklin Pierce, Albert Sidney Johnston, and Robert E. Lee.</p><p>With the use of contemporary accounts and Davis's own correspondence, <i>Jefferson Davis, Unconquerable Heart</i> casts new light upon this remarkable man, thawing the icy image of Davis in many previous accounts. Felicity Allen shows a strong, yet gentle man; a stern soldier who loved horses, guns, poetry, and children; a master of the English language, with a dry wit; a man of powerful feelings who held them in such tight control that he was considered cold; and a home-loving Mississippian who was drawn into a vortex of national events and eventual catastrophe. At all times, "duty, honor, country" ruled his mind. Davis's Christian view of life runs like a thread throughout the book, binding together his devotion to God, his family, and the land.</p><p><i>Jefferson Davis, Unconquerable Heart</i> brings Davis to life in a way that has never been done before. The variety of his experience, the breadth of his learning, and the consistency of his beliefs make this historical figure eminently worth knowing.</p></p><p><p>Felicity Allen, an independent scholar, lives in Auburn, Alabama.</p>As her title suggests, Allen, an independent scholar, has written a sentimental account of the life of the president of the Confederate States of America. Davis's wife, Varina, along with their children, play a central role in a narrative that draws heavily on Davis's own correspondence. Allen depicts Davis as a caring husband, a loving father, a virtuous public servant and the very embodiment of Southern chivalry. This is anything but a critical biography; what Allen strives earnestly to convey is the strict moral code that Davis lived by, a code emphasizing honesty, self-sacrifice, loyalty to family, physical and moral courage and respect for Southern tradition. Davis was, foremost, a soldier; ironically, the tactical and technical innovations that he introduced at the antebellum War Department greatly enhanced the preparedness of the Union army, thus contributing to the defeat of his beloved Confederacy. As a senator from Mississippi, Davis was at the boiling center of the slavery debate, arguing that servitude civilized and Christianized African-Americans and was sanctioned by both the Bible and the Constitution. Allen doesn't contribute much to our larger understanding of the period; the political "crisis" of the 1850s, with Davis heading the Southern faction in the Senate, has been better described elsewhere, as has the complex military history of the Civil War. What Allen contributes is an emphasis on Davis the family man and Davis the martyred symbol of a vanquished but proud and unrepentant South. While she largely succeeds in portraying Davis as a noble individual and as the personification of Southern "glory," she's unable to solve the ultimate conundrum: how a supposedly great man could devote his public life to defending slavery. 72 illus. not seen by PW.

This book by two distinguished scholars&#x2015;a computer scientist and a linguist&#x2015;addresses the enduring question of the evolution of language.</p><p>Robert Berwick and Noam Chomsky explain that until recently the evolutionary question could not be properly posed, because we did not have a clear idea of how to define &#x201c;language&#x201d; and therefore what it was that had evolved. But since the Minimalist Program, developed by Chomsky and others, we know the key ingredients of language and can put together an account of the evolution of human language and what distinguishes us from all other animals.</p><p>Berwick and Chomsky discuss the biolinguistic perspective on language, which views language as a particular object of the biological world; the computational efficiency of language as a system of thought and understanding; the tension between Darwin's idea of gradual change and our contemporary understanding about evolutionary change and language; and evidence from nonhuman animals, in particular vocal learning in songbirds.</p></p><p>Robert C.

Alexei, Elena, and Nikolka Turbin have just lost their mother their father had died years before and find themselves plunged into the chaotic civil war that erupted in the Ukraine in the wake of the Russian Revolution. In the context of this family&#x2019;s personal loss and the social turmoil surrounding them, Bulgakov creates a brilliant picture of the existential crises brought about by the revolution and the loss of social, moral, and political certainties. He confronts the reader with the bewildering cruelty that ripped Russian life apart at the beginning of the last century as well as with the extraordinary ways in which the Turbins preserved their humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this volume Marian Schwartz, a leading translator, offers the first complete and accurate translation of the definitive original text of Bulgakov&#x2019;s novel. She includes the famous dream sequence, omitted in previous translations, and beautifully solves the stylistic issues raised by Bulgakov&#x2019;s ornamental prose. Readers with an interest in Russian literature, culture, or history will welcome this superb translation of Bulgakov&#x2019;s important early work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This edition also contains an informative historical essay by Evgeny Dobrenko.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><i>The White Guard</i> is less famous than Mikhail Bulgakov's comic hit, The Master and Margarita, but it is a lovely book, though completely different in tone. It is set in Kiev during the Russian revolution and tells a story about the war's effect on a middle-class family (not workers). The story was not politically correct and thereby contributed to Bulgakov's lifelong troubles with the Soviet authorities. It was, however, well-loved, and the novel was turned into a successful play at the time of its publication in 1967.<p>Marian Schwartz is a prize-winning translator of Russian who recently received her second Translation Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts to translate Olga Slavnikova&#x2019;s newest novel, <i>2017</i>.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He died on April 23, 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford.&nbsp;<br><br> <b>A.

He has written critical volumes on George Peele and George Chapman and has edited plays in both the Oxford (<i>King John</i>) and Cambridge (<i>Macbeth</i>) series of Shakespeare editions.

His books include&nbsp;<i>Imagining Shakespeare</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Authentic Shakespeare</i>,&nbsp;<i>Impersonations: The Performance of Gender in Shakespeare&#x2019;s England</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Illusion of Power</i>.<i>Introduction<br></i><br><br>Shakespeare probably wrote <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in 1606 or 1607; it was registered for publication on May 20, 1608, and apparently influenced a revision of Samuel Daniel&#x2019;s <i>Cleopatra</i> that was published &#x201c;newly altered&#x201d; in 1607. Antony and Cleopatra was thus roughly contemporary with <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>. Yet the contrast between those two tragedies and Antony and Cleopatra is immense. Unlike <i>Macbeth</i>, with its taut focus on a murderer and his wife, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> moves back and forth across the Mediterranean in its epic survey of characters and events, bringing together the fates of Pompey, Octavius Caesar, Octavia, and Lepidus with those of the protagonists. <i>King Lear</i> gives proper names to fourteen characters, Macbeth to eighteen, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> to thirty-four. The Roman play requires no fewer than forty-two separate scenes, of which most occur in what modern editors label Acts 3 and 4, although no play is less suited to the classical rigors of five-act structure, and these divisions are not found in the reliable Folio text of 1623. Indeed, it is as though Shakespeare resolved at the height of his career to show that he could dispense entirely with the classical &#x201c;rules,&#x201d; which had never taken serious hold of the English popular stage in any case. The flouting of the unities is so extreme that John Dryden, in his <i>All for Love, or The World Well Lost </i>(1678), undertook not so much to revise Shakespeare as to start afresh on the same subject. Dryden&#x2019;s play is restricted to the last few hours of the protagonists&#x2019; lives, at Cleopatra&#x2019;s tomb in Alexandria, with a severely limited cast of characters and much of the narrative revealed through recollection. Although a substantial achievement in its own right, <i>All for Love</i> surely demonstrates that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, for Dryden has excised a good deal of the panorama, the excitement, and the &#x201c;infinite variety&#x201d; (2.2.246).<br><br>Shakespeare departs also from the somber tone of his tragedies of evil. He creates, instead, a world that bears affinities to the ambiguous conflicts of the other Roman plays, to the varying humorous perspectives of the comedies, and to the imaginative reconstructions of the late romances. As protagonists, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> lack tragic stature, or so it first appears: she is a tawny gypsy temptress and he a &#x201c;strumpet&#x2019;s fool,&#x201d; a once-great general now bound in &#x201c;strong Egyptian fetters&#x201d; and lost in &#x201c;dotage&#x201d; (1.1.13; 1.2.122&#x2014;3). Several scenes, especially those set in Egypt, are comic and delightfully bawdy: Charmian learning her fortune from the soothsayer, Cleopatra practicing her charms in vain to keep Antony from leaving Egypt or raunchily daydreaming of being Antony&#x2019;s horse &#x201c;to bear the weight of Antony&#x201d; (1.5.22), Cleopatra flying into a magnificent rage at the news of Antony&#x2019;s marriage to Octavia and then consoling herself with catty reflections on Octavia&#x2019;s reported low voice and shortness of stature (&#x201c;I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue, and dwarfish,&#x201d; 3.3.17). In its comic texture, the play somewhat resembles <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, an earlier play about a younger pair of lovers, although there the bawdry is used chiefly to characterize the lovers&#x2019; companions and confidants, whereas in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> it is central to our vision of Cleopatra especially. In any case, the later play is a tragedy about lovers who, despite their quarrels and uncertainties and betrayals of self, are reconciled in a vision of the greatness of their love. In its depiction of two contrasting worlds, also, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> recalls the movement of several earlier comedies from the realistic world of political conniving to a dream-world of the romantic and the unexpected. We can endorse neither world fully in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and, accordingly, the vision of life presented is often ambivalent and ironic as much as it is tragic. The contrast of values separating Egypt and Rome underscores the paradox of humanity&#x2019;s quest for seemingly irreconcilable goals. The ending is neither a triumph nor a defeat for the lovers but something of both. If Antony and Cleopatra seem in one way too small to be tragic protagonists, in another way they seem too large, creating imaginative visions of themselves and their union that escape the realm of tragedy altogether. Our attention is focused less on the way in which the protagonists come to understand some meaningful relationship between their character and the fate required of them by a tragic universe than on the almost comic way in which the absurdities of Roman worldly striving and Egyptian dissipation are transfigured in the world of the imagination.<br><br>The Roman point of view opens the play and never entirely loses its force. At first, it may seem superior to that of Egypt. Demetrius and Philo, who invite us to view the play&#x2019;s first encounter between Antony and Cleopatra (1.1) from the perspective of the professional Roman soldier, lament the decline of Antony into Circean enslavement. Their tragic concept is of the Fall of Princes, all the more soberly edifying because of the height from which Antony has toppled. &#x201c;You shall see in him / The triple pillar of the world transformed / Into a strumpet&#x2019;s fool&#x201d; (1.1.11&#x2014;13). Egypt is enchanting but clearly enervating&#x2013;a bizarre assemblage of soothsayers, eunuchs, and waiting- gentlewomen who wish to be &#x201c;married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all&#x201d; (1.2.28&#x2014;9). Their mirth is all bawdry, tinged with practices, such as transvestitism, that Roman custom views as licentious. The prevailing images are of procreation in various shapes, sleep (mandragora, Lethe), the oriental opulence of Cleopatra&#x2019;s barge (a golden poop, purple sails, silver oars, divers-colored fans), Epicurean feasting, and drinking. As Enobarbus says, &#x201c;Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be&#x2013;drunk to bed&#x201d; (1.2.47&#x2014;8).<br><br>Antony, for all his reckless defiance of Rome, agrees in his more reflective moments with what Demetrius and Philo have said. &#x201c;A Roman thought hath struck him,&#x201d; Cleopatra observantly remarks, and Antony has indeed determined that &#x201c;I must from this enchanting queen break off&#x201d; (1.2.88, 135). His later return to Cleopatra is at least in part a surrender, a betrayal of his marriage vows to Octavia and his political assurances to Caesar. In the ensuing battles, Antony submits himself dangerously to Cleopatra&#x2019;s governance, and this inversion of dominance in sexual roles, as conventionally understood by the Roman patriarchal world, is emblematic of a deeper disorder within Antony. As Enobarbus concludes bitterly, Antony &#x201c;would make his will / Lord of his reason&#x201d; and so has subverted his &#x201c;judgment&#x201d; (3.13.3&#x2014;4, 37) to passion.<br><br>From the beginning, Cleopatra has sought dominance over Antony in the war of the sexes. When Antony first came to her on the River Cydnus, we learn, he was so overcome in all his senses that he was &#x201c;barbered ten times o&#x2019;er&#x201d; (2.2.234). Cleopatra boasts that she &#x201c;angled&#x201d; for Antony on many occasions, catching him the way fishermen &#x201c;betray&#x201d; fish, and that, when she had &#x201c;drunk him to his bed,&#x201d; she &#x201c;put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan&#x201d; (2.5.10&#x2014;23). Caesar, affronted by such transvestite debauchery, charges that Antony &#x201c;is not more manlike / Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy / More womanly than he&#x201d; (1.4.5&#x2014;7). During the battle scenes, Antony&#x2019;s followers complain that &#x201c;Photinus, an eunuch&#x201d; (probably Mardian), and Cleopatra&#x2019;s maids manage the war: &#x201c;So our leader&#x2019;s led, / And we are women&#x2019;s men&#x201d; (3.7.14&#x2014;15, 70&#x2014;1). Antony confesses too late that they were right. He becomes a &#x201c;doting mallard,&#x201d; one whose heart is &#x201c;tied by th&#x2019; strings&#x201d; to Cleopatra&#x2019;s rudder when her ships retreat in the first naval engagement (3.10.20; 3.11.56). In the mythic images used to raise their relationship to heroic proportions, Antony is like Mars to Cleopatra&#x2019;s Venus (1.5.19), in both a positive and a negative sense. The image has positive connotations of the way in which, as Milton puts it, the &#x201c;two great sexes animate the world,&#x201d; the masterful soldier and his attractive consort complementing one another in a right relationship of martial prowess and beauty, bravery and love, reason and will; however, to the Renaissance, the myth of Mars and Venus could also be read in a destructive sense, as an adulterous relationship in which reason is subverted to appetite. In another mythic comparison, Antony is like Hercules, not in his prime, but with the shirt of Nessus on his back&#x2013;a poisoned shirt given to Hercules by his wife in a mistaken hope of thereby assuring his love for her (4.12.43). Antony&#x2019;s soldiers understandably believe that the god Hercules has deserted his reputed descendant and onetime champion (4.3.21&#x2014;2).<br><br>Despite Antony&#x2019;s shameful violation of manhood, honor, attention to duty, self-knowledge, and all that Rome stands for, however, the end of his story is anything but a one-sided endorsement for the Roman point of view. The actual Rome, disfigured by political conniving, falls far short of the ideal. Antony has a point when he protests that &#x201c;Kingdoms are clay&#x201d; (1.1.37). Alliances are unstable and are governed by mere political expediency. At first, Antony&#x2019;s wife Fulvia and his brother Lucius have fought one another until forced to unite against the greater threat of Octavius Caesar. Similarly, Antony and Caesar come together only because Pompey has become dangerously powerful at sea and has won the favor of the fickle mob, &#x201c;Our slippery people&#x201d; (1.2.192). This d�tente is not meant to last. As Enobarbus bluntly puts it, &#x201c;if you borrow one another&#x2019;s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again&#x201d; (2.2.109&#x2014;11). Enobarbus is rebuked for his unstatesmanlike tone, but no one denies the validity of what he says. In this cynical negotiation, Octavia is a pawn between husband and brother, shabbily treated by both. Caesar coldly bargains away the happiness of the one person of whom he protests that &#x201c;no brother / Did ever love so dearly&#x201d; (2.2.159&#x2014;60). Antony, although hating false promises and resolving to be loyal to Octavia, knows within himself that it won&#x2019;t work. To make matters worse for the fair-minded Antony, he has received great favors from Pompey that he must now uncharitably repudiate in the interests of politics. Pompey does not miss the opportunity to remind Antony of his ingratitude, but the prevailing mood is not so much of bitterness as of ironic futility. Old friendships must be sacrificed; no one seems wholly to blame, and no one can stop the game. Pompey is as much in the wrong as anyone and as powerless. Despite his idealistic hope of restoring republican government to Rome, he has had to ally himself with pirates who offer him sinister temptations. He could be &#x201c;lord of all the world&#x201d; (2.7.62) if he would only murder on occasion, but Pompey is destined to be trapped between lofty ends and ignoble means. Lepidus is still another dismaying victim of political callousness, used condescendingly by Caesar and permitted to drink himself into oblivion, until he is cashiered on a trumped-up charge and imprisoned for life.<br><br>Octavius Caesar embodies most of all the ironic limits of political ambition. He has avoided enslavement to passion at the very real cost of enslaving himself to his public career as general, triumvir, and future emperor. His ideal warrior is one who, driven by military necessity, would &#x201c;drink / The stale [urine] of horses and the gilded puddle / Which beasts would cough at&#x201d; (1.4.62&#x2014;4). As a general, he is Antony&#x2019;s opposite in every way. He attacks only when he has the advantage and places those who have deserted Antony in his own front lines so &#x201c;That Antony may seem to spend his fury / Upon himself&#x201d; (4.6.10&#x2014;11). He controls his supplies cannily, believing it a &#x201c;waste&#x201d; to feast his army (4.1.17). He, of course, declines Antony&#x2019;s offers of single combat. Antony meantime recklessly accepts Caesar&#x2019;s challenge to fight at sea, feasts debauchingly in one &#x201c;gaudy night&#x201d; after another (3.13.186), and generously refuses to blame or penalize those who leave him. His sending Enobarbus&#x2019;s belongings after him into Caesar&#x2019;s camp convinces that honest soldier he has made a fatal error, for, however imprudent Antony&#x2019;s chivalry may be, it is unquestionably noble and great-hearted. Caesar is a superb general and political genius, but he is also a military automaton, a logistical reckoner, a Machiavellian pragmatist. In his personal life, he is no less austere and puritanical. He deplores loosening his tongue with alcohol. About women, he is deeply cynical, believing that &#x201c;want will perjure / The ne&#x2019;er-touched vestal&#x201d; (3.12.30&#x2014;1). Between him and Cleopatra, there is a profound antipathy, based in part on his revulsion at her earlier affair with his namesake and adoptive father, Julius Caesar (3.6.6). Cleopatra may entertain briefly the notion of trying to seduce this new Caesar (3.13.46 ff.), for like Charmian she loves long life &#x201c;better than figs&#x201d; (1.2.34), but, if so, she soon discovers that she and Caesar are not compatible. All that he represents she must instead grandly repudiate, choosing death and the fantasy of an eternity with Antony as her way to &#x201c;call great Caesar ass / Unpolicied&#x201d; (5.2.307&#x2014;8).</p><h2>Taking Rights Seriously</h2><p><p> What is law? What is it for? How should judges decide novel cases when the statutes and earlier decisions provide no clear answer? Do judges make up new law in such cases, or is there some higher law in which they discover the correct answer? Must everyone always obey the law? If not, when is a citizen morally free to disobey? </p><p> A renowned philosopher enters the debate surrounding these questions. Clearly and forcefully, Ronald Dworkin argues against the "ruling" theory in Anglo-American law-legal positivism and economic utilitarianism and asserts that individuals have legal rights beyond those explicitly laid down and that they have political and moral rights against the state that are prior to the welfare of the majority. </p><p> Mr. Dworkin criticizes in detail the legal positivists' theory of legal rights, particularly H. L. A. Hart's well-known version of it. He then develops a new theory of adjudication, and applies it to the central and politically important issue of cases in which the Supreme Court interprets and applies the Constitution. Through an analysis of Rawls's theory of justice, he argues that fundamental among political rights is the right of each individual to the equal respect and concern of those who govern him. He offers a theory of compliance with the law designed not simply to answer theoretical questions about civil disobedience, but to function as a guide for citizens and officials. Finally, Professor Dworkin considers the right to liberty, often thought to rival and even pre-empt the fundamental right to equality. He argues that distinct individual liberties do exist, but that they derive, not from some abstract right to liberty as such, but from the right to equal concern and respect itself. He thus denies that liberty and equality are conflicting ideals. </p><p> Ronald Dworkin's theory of law and the moral conception of individual rights that underlies it have already made him one of the most influential philosophers working in this area. This is the first publication of these ideas in book form. </p></p><p><b>Ronald Dworkin</b> is Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University and Jeremy Bentham Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London. He is the 2007 recipient of the Holberg International Memorial Prize.The most important work in jurisprudence since H. L. .A.

Biedelman Zoo.</p> <p>A charming, poignant, and captivating novel certain to enthrall readers of <i>Water for Elephants</i>, Diane Hammond's <i>Hannah's Dream</i> is a beautifully told tale rich in heart, humor, and intelligence.</p></p><p><p>Diane Hammond is the author of the critically acclaimed novels <em>Seeing Stars, Hannah's Dream, Going to Bend,</em> and <em>Homesick Creek.</em> She served as a spokesperson for the Free Willy Keiko Foundation and the Oregon Coast Aquarium and currently lives in St. Paul, Minnesota, with her husband and their three Pembroke Welsh corgis.</p>*Starred Review* On the animal kingdom&#x2019;s 10-point scale of adorable critters, golden retriever puppies regularly come in on top, while aging gray elephants rarely make it onto the list. But when it comes to lovability, Hannah, the sole elephant at Seattle&#x2019;s dilapidated Max L. Biedelman Zoo, is off the charts. Rescued as a baby by the zoo&#x2019;s founder while on safari in Africa, Hannah has been cared for by Samson Brown for her 41-year captivity. Theirs is an empathetic, symbiotic relationship as Samson transfers all the love deflected by the death of his only child into caring for this slightly needy, somewhat neurotic, but always affectionate creature. But Samson is aging and his health is failing, and the zoo needs a plan. Enter Neva Wilson, an energetic young zookeeper whose creative ideas for Hannah&#x2019;s well-being immediately put her afoul of Harriet Saul, the zoo&#x2019;s petty, tyrannical administrator. To save Hannah&#x2019;s life, Samson and Neva scheme to transfer her to an elephant sanctuary, though their plan comes with great personal risk. Irresistibly touching, delectably uplifting, Hammond&#x2019;s understated yet gargantuan tale of devotion and commitment poignantly proves that love does indeed come in all shapes and sizes. --Carol Haggas</p><h2>The Senses of Walden: An Expanded Edition</h2><p><b>Stanley Cavell</b>, one of America's most distinguished philosophers, has written an invaluable companion volume to <i>Walden</i>, a seminal book in our cultural heritage.

Eamon Duffy recreates fifteenth-century English lay people's experience of religion, revealing the richness and complexity of the Catholicism by which men and women structured their experience of the world and their hopes within and beyond it. He then tells the powerful story of the destruction of that Church - the stripping of the altars - from Henry VIII's break with the papacy until the Elizabethan settlement. Bringing together theological, liturgical, literary, and iconographic analysis with historical narrative, Duffy argues that late medieval Catholicism was neither decadent nor decayed but was a strong and vigorous tradition, and that the Reformation represented the violent rupture of a popular and theologically respectable religious system.<br>The first part of the book reviews the main features of religious belief and practice up to 1536. Duffy examines the factors that contributed to the close lay engagement with the structures of late medieval Catholicism: the liturgy that was widely understood even though it was in Latin; the impact of literacy and printing on lay religious knowledge; the conventions and contents of lay prayer; the relation of orthodox religious practice and magic; the Mass and the cult of the saints; and lay belief about death and the afterlife. In the second part of the book Duffy explores the impact of Protestant reforms on this traditional religion, providing new evidence of popular discontent from medieval wills and parish records. He documents the widespread opposition to Protestantism during the reigns of Henry and Edward, discusses Mary's success in reestablishing Catholicism, and describes the public resistance to Elizabeth's dismantling of parochial Catholicism that did not wane until the late 1570s. A major revision to accepted thinking about the spread of the Reformation, this book will be essential reading for students of British history and religion.</p><p>This prize-winning account of the pre-Reformation church recreates lay people&#x2019;s experience of religion in fifteenth-century England.

A tour-de-force exploration of guilt, responsibility, and history, the play opened a window on the playwright's marriage to the late Marilyn Monroe. <i>Incident at Vichy</i> (1964) dramatizes the round-up of Jews in Vichy France in a vivid single act. <i>The Price</i> (1968), a Broadway hit, follows two brothers, a successful surgeon and a struggling policeman, as they figure out how to dispose of their dead father's belongings. <i>The Creation of the World and Other Business</i> (1972) and <i>Up from Paradise</i> (1974) treat characteristically grand themes in uncharacteristically comedic and musical forms. <i>The American Clock</i> (1974) is a "vaudeville" about the Depression years, while <i>The Archbishop's Ceiling</i> (1977), set in a room in Soviet-era Prague that may or may not be bugged, is a meditation on trust and betrayal.

During the 2006 World Cup finals, Zidane stunned the country by ending his spectacular career with an assault on an Italian player. In <i>Soccer Empire</i>, Laurent Dubois illuminates the connections between empire and sport by tracing the story of World Cup soccer, from the Cup&#x2019;s French origins in the 1930s to Africa and the Caribbean and back again. As he vividly recounts the lives of two of soccer&#x2019;s most electrifying players, Zidane and his outspoken teammate, Lilian Thuram, Dubois deepens our understanding of the legacies of empire that persist in Europe and brilliantly captures the power of soccer to change the nation and the world.</p><p>"Laurent Dubois mines the history of French soccer for fascinating theories and riveting stories. His understanding of the relationship between the game and politics is subtle, leading readers deep into important discussions about race and national identity. For those of us who admired the poetics of Les Bleus this is essential reading."&#x2015;Franklin Foer, author of <i>How Soccer Explains the World</i><br><br>"Laurent Dubois is historian, fan and graceful writer all in one. In soccer, he has found an innovative way to explore France and its empire. A serious book and an excellent read."&#x2015;Simon Kuper, author of <i>Soccernomics</i><br><br>"Beautifully lyrical and authoritative. We meet a host of players, colonized and colonizer, following them from their original playing fields&#x2015;a vast lawn, a concrete lot&#x2015;to their triumphs in national and international play." &#x2015;Alice Kaplan, author of <i>The Interpreter</i><br><br>"This book is a brilliant, beautifully written, and unique history of French colonialism and post-coloniality through the lens of football/soccer. Dubois weaves an eminently readable and engaging narrative that tracks tensions around race and national identity through the biographies of key football players and officials who became iconic of the aspirations of peripheral subjects of the French empire. More than a simple history of French football, the book amounts to a description of France's imperial project and an incisive reflection on the race question in contemporary France. It will please both fans of the 'beautiful game' and those inclined to dismiss sports as but the opium of the masses."&#x2015;Paul Silverstein, author of <i>Algeria in France: Transpolitics, Race and Nation</i><b>Laurent Dubois</b> is Professor of French and History at Duke University.

This new volume contains six of her finest stories that have been selected specifically to demonstrate this, and to trace the development of her art. As diverse in setting as in subject matter, these tales move from the gentle comedy of life in a small English country town in Dr Harrison s Confessions, to atmospheric horror in far north-west Wales with The Doom of the Griffiths. The story of Cousin Phillis, her masterly tale of love and loss, is a subtle, complex and perceptive analysis of changes in English national life during an industrial age, while the gripping Lois the Witch recreates the terrors of the Salem witchcraft trials in seventeenth-century New England, as Gaskell shrewdly shows the numerous roots of this furious outbreak of delusion. Whimsically modified fairy tales are set in a French chateau, while an engaging love story poetically evokes peasant life in wine-growing Germany.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Sanskrit, Part 2</h2><p>This book in two volumes, is designed to open the door to india&#39;s rich spiritual literature.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Five Great Novels (GOLLANCZ S.F.)</h2><p><p><b>Five of Philip K.

(filmed as BLADERUNNER), MARTIAN TIME SLIP, UBIK, THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH and A SCANNER DARKLY. Taken together they represent the best of Philip K. Dick's unique imagination. </p><p>In Dick's writing nothing is what it seems, our sense of the world's order is fatally undermined and mass media tells us nothing but artful lies. Films such as THE MATRIX and THE TRUMAN SHOW would not have been made but for Philip K. Dick. His work has never been more timely.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Modern Researcher</h2><p>This classic introduction to the techniques of research and the art of expression is used widely in history courses, but is also appropriate for writing and research methods courses in other departments. Barzun and Graff thoroughly cover every aspect of research, from the selection of a topic through the gathering, analysis, writing, revision, and publication of findings presenting the process not as a set of rules but through actual cases that put the subtleties of research in a useful context. Part One covers the principles and methods of research; Part Two covers writing, speaking, and getting one&#39;s work published.</p><p>The two authors of this book have had their professional career in history, JACQUES BARZUN in Modern Cultural, HENRY F. GRAFF in American Political and Diplomatic, both at Colombia University. They first collaborated in creating the course in historical method required of all first-year graduate students, and the material for it was and remains the core of The Modern Researcher. Both scholars have published widely in periodicals of specialist and general interest and each has a list of influential books to his credit. Jacques Barzun�s latest is From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural History. A summing up of his lifelong studies, it stayed on the best-seller list for weeks in 2000.

It is the most popular style for social correspondence, invitations, and other communications requiring an elegant hand.<br>In this practical manual, a noted calligraphy teacher offers a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for the student. Beginning with a brief but fascinating history of copperplate, she moves quickly to an in-depth examination of the alphabet, numbers, and punctuation. Each letter is demonstrated stroke by stroke with a clear explanation.<br>Readers will also find detailed discussions of writing in color, using the proper paper, and learning how to retouch, correct, and crop. Ms. Winters then shows how copperplate can be used to write a simple paragraph, a short quotation, or poetry, and explains how to use the script commercially for addressing envelopes and writing name cards and invitations. With this easy-to-follow manual and some practice, calligraphers will be able to create copperplate scripts with the rhythm, grace, and ease of the great writing masters.<br>Unabridged Dover (2000) republication of the edition published by Watson-Guptill, New York, 1989.</p></p><h2>Robert Therrien: Polaroids And Drawings</h2><p>At once concrete and fanciful, Robert Therrien&#39;s photographs and drawings do not so much represent the world as offer a way of looking at it, being in it, and dreaming about it. Dealing magically in objects and the space that surrounds them, his artworks suspend stacks of dishes, slept-on pillows, table legs and gently geomteric patches of color and line in a charmed world that somehow is our own.</p><p></p><h2>Into Thin Air : Personal Account of the Everest Disaster</h2><p>This is the true story of a 24-hour period on Everest, when members of three separate expeditions were caught in a storm and faced a battle against hurricane-force winds, exposure, and the effects of altitude, which ended the worst single-season death toll in the peak&#39;s history.</p><p>"Intrinsically irrational" is how Jon Krakauer characterizes the compulsion to climb Mount Everest in his audiobook <i>Into Thin Air</i>. The highly publicized fates of the May 1996 Everest expeditions, including the tragic loss of 12 lives, seem to bear out Krakauer's statement. Listening to Krakauer read his own account of the events in this unabridged version adds a uniquely intimate and thought-provoking dimension to the tragedy. Although Krakauer reads his account with journalistic professionalism, it's impossible to forget that you are listening to someone unburdening himself of a great weight, an unburdening that sometimes nearly approaches a confession.<p> Since the 1980s, more and more "marginally qualified dreamers" have attempted the ascent of Everest, as guided commercial expeditions have dangled the possibility of reaching the roof of the world in front of anyone wealthy enough to pay for the privilege. In 1996, <i>Outside</i> magazine asked Krakauer, a frequent contributor, to write a piece on the commercialization of Everest, and Krakauer signed on as a member of New Zealander Rob Hall's expedition. The disastrous outcome of the 1996 expedition forced Krakauer to write a very different article. </p><p> Those who read Krakauer's book may wonder whether the audiobook can possibly shed more light on the unfortunate events. It does. Krakauer's chronicle is chilling and horrifying. He recounts with excruciating detail the physical and mental cost of such a climb. Even under the best of circumstances, each step up the ice-clad mountain is monumentally exhausting, and the oxygen-deprived brain loses the ability to make reliable judgements. And on May 10, 1996, when Hall's expedition and several others made their summit assault, the conditions were far from ideal. The mountain was so "crowded" that climbers had to wait their turn near the summit while their bottled oxygen dwindled by the minute. By afternoon a blinding hurricane-force storm had stranded a number of climbers on the highest, most exposed reaches of the mountain.</p><p> By writing and reading <i>Into Thin Air</i>, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer's highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber's death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself.

As commander he never lost a battle. Yet it is his adversary, Hannibal, who has lived on in the public memory, due mostly to his daring march through the Alps with his elephants. At the Battle of the Ticinus, Hannibal's initial encounter with Roman arms, young Scipio first tasted warfare, rescuing his dangerously wounded, encircled father, who was also the Roman commander. By nineteen Scipio was the equivalent of a staff colonel and in 210 B.C. he was placed in supreme command. In three years he destroyed Carthaginian power in Spain and, after being made consul, took his forces to Africa, where he conquered Carthage's great ally, Syphax. Two years later he clashed with Hannibal himself, annihilating his army in the decisive Battle of Zama. For this triumph and his other exploits in the Punic Wars, Scipio was awarded the title Africanus.In his fascinating portrait of this extraordinary commander, B. H. Liddell Hart writes, &#x201d;The age of generalship does not age, and it is because Scipio's battles are richer in stratagems and ruses many still feasible today than those of any other commander in history that they are an unfailing object lesson.&#x201d; Not only military enthusiasts and historians but all those interested in outstanding men will find this magnificent study absorbing and gripping.</p><p>Captain <b>Basil Henry Liddell Hart </b>(1895&#x2013;1970) was one of the foremost military theorists of our time.

That night, Marie&#x2019;s extraordinary present comes to life, defends her from the taunting Mouse King, and whisks her off to the Kingdom of Dolls. The inspiration for the classic ballet, E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x2019;s irresistible tale of magic and childhood adventure continues to captivate readers of all ages. Today, many of the most enchanting symbols of Christmas, from nutcrackers to sugar plums to mistletoe, are still imbued with the power of this story.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Penguin Christmas Classics</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Give the gift of literature this Christmas.<br>&nbsp;<br>Penguin Christmas Classics honor the power of literature to keep on giving through the ages. The six volumes in the series are not only our most beloved Christmas tales, they also have given us much of what we love about the holiday itself. <i>A Christmas Carol</i> revived in Victorian England such Christmas hallmarks as the Christmas tree, holiday cards, and caroling. The Yuletide yarns of Anthony Trollope popularized throughout the British Empire and around the world the trappings of Christmas in London. <i>The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&nbsp;</i>created the origin story for the presiding spirit of Christmas as we know it.&nbsp;The holiday tales of Louisa May Alcott shaped the ideal of an American Christmas. <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> brought forth some of our earliest Christmas traditions as passed down through folk tales. And <i>The Nutcracker</i> inspired the most famous ballet in history, one seen by millions in the twilight of every year.<br>&nbsp;<br>Beautifully designed hardcovers&#x2014;with foil-stamped jackets, decorative endpapers, and nameplates for personalization&#x2014;in a small trim size that makes them perfect stocking stuffers, Penguin Christmas Classics embody the spirit of giving that is at the heart of our most time-honored stories about the holiday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Collect all six Penguin Christmas Classics:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>A Christmas Carol</i> by Charles Dickens<br><i>Christmas at Thompson Hall: And Other Christmas Stories</i> by Anthony Trollope<br><i>The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&nbsp;</i>by L.

T. A. Hoffmann</b> (1776&#x2013;1822) was one of the best known and most influential authors of his time.&nbsp;<i>Phantasiest�cke</i>, his earliest collection of tales, appeared in 1814. This was followed three years later by <i>Nachst�cke </i>and then in 1819&#x2013;21 by <i>Die Serapoins br�der.</i>&nbsp;Among his longer works is his second and final novel,<i> Die Lebensansichten des Katers Murr </i>(<i>The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr</i>), which represents the highpoint of his art. He exploited the grotesque and the bizarre in a manner unmatched by any other Romantic writer.<br><br><b>Joachim Neugroschel</b> (translator; 1938&#x2013;2011) won three PEN translation awards and the French-American Foundation Translation Prize. He translated Thomas Mann&#x2019;s <i>Death in Venice </i>and Sacher-Masoch&#x2019;s<i> Venus in Furs</i>, among other works, for Penguin Classics.<p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Christmas Eve</p><p>FOR THE ENTIRE TWENTY-FOURTH OF DECEMBER, the children of Medical Officer Stahlbaum were not permitted to step inside the intermediary room, much less the magnificent showcase next door. Fritz and Marie sat huddled together in a corner of the back room. The deep evening dusk had set in, and the children felt quite eerie because, as was usual on this day, no light had been brought in. Fritz quite secretly whispered to his younger sister (she had just turned seven) that he had heard a rustling and murmuring and soft throbbing in the locked rooms since early that morning. Also, not so long ago (Fritz went on), a short, dark man with a large casket under his arm had stolen across the vestibule. However, said Fritz, he knew quite well that it was none other than Godfather Drosselmeier.</p><p>Marie joyfully clapped her little hands and exclaimed: &#x201c;Ah, I wonder what lovely presents he&#x2019;s made for us!&#x201d;</p><p>Supreme Court Justice Drosselmeier was anything but handsome. He was short and scrawny, his face was covered with wrinkles, and he wore a big, black patch instead of a right eye. He also had no hair on his head, which is why he sported a very lovely periwig made of spun glass and very artistic. Indeed, the godfather was altogether a very artistic man, who even knew a thing or two about clocks and could actually build them. So if any of the beautiful clocks in Stahlbaum&#x2019;s home fell ill and couldn&#x2019;t sing, Godfather Drosselmeier would come by, remove his glass periwig, take off his snug yellow vest, tie on a blue apron, and insert sharp instruments into the gears. It was very painful for little Marie, but it didn&#x2019;t harm the clock at all. In fact, the clock even grew lively, and it started cheerfully humming, striking, and singing again, much to everyone&#x2019;s delight.</p><p>Whenever Drosselmeier visited them, he would bring something nice for the children. His pocket might contain a manikin that could twist its eyes and bow&#x2014;which was comical to see. Or Drosselmeier might have a box from which a little bird came hopping out, or he might have something utterly different. But for Christmas, Drosselmeier always completed a gorgeous artistic work, which cost him a great effort. That is why, after showing the gift, the parents very cautiously stored it away.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, I wonder what lovely presents he&#x2019;s made for us,&#x201d; Marie exclaimed.</p><p>Fritz decided that this year it could be nothing but a fortress, where all kinds of very handsome soldiers drilled and marched to and fro. Next, other soldiers would have to storm and invade the fortress. But now the inside soldiers boldly shot their cannons, making them boom and burst.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no!&#x201d; Marie interrupted Fritz. &#x201c;Godfather Drosselmeier told me about a beautiful park with a huge lake and with marvelous swans gliding about and wearing gold neckbands and singing the loveliest songs. Then a little girl comes to the lake and entices the swans and feeds them sweet marzipan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Swans don&#x2019;t eat marzipan,&#x201d; Fritz broke in quite roughly, &#x201c;and Godfather Drosselmeier can&#x2019;t make a whole park. Actually, we get little out of his toys. They&#x2019;re promptly taken away from us. So I much prefer what Mama and Papa give us. We can keep their presents nicely and do whatever we like with them.&#x201d;</p><p>Now the children debated what their parents would bring them. Marie felt that Fr�ulein Trutchen (her large doll) was changing deeply. For, clumsier than ever, she fell on the floor every moment. This didn&#x2019;t happen without a nasty grin, and there was no further thought of the cleanliness of her garments. Nor did a thorough scolding help. Also, Mama, we are told, smiled with such delight at Gretchen&#x2019;s small parasol. Fritz, by contrast, assured the others that his royal stable lacked a good sorrel, just as his troops fully lacked a cavalry&#x2014;Papa was well aware of that.</p><p>So the children knew that their parents had bought them all kinds of beautiful presents, which they now displayed. But the children were also certain that the dear Holy Christ shone upon them with the pious and friendly eyes of children. And they were equally convinced that, as if touched by fruitful hands, every Christmas gift would bring marvelous pleasure like no other.</p><p>The children, who kept whispering about the expected presents, were reminded of that pleasure by their older sister, Luise. And they added that it was now also the Holy Christ, who, through the hands of their dear parents, always gave them whatever real joy and pleasure He could bring them. Indeed, He knew that a lot better than did the children themselves, who didn&#x2019;t have to nurture all sorts of hopes and wishes. Rather, they had to wait, still and pious, for their Christmas presents.</p><p>Little Marie grew pensive, while Fritz murmured to himself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to have a sorrel and Hussars.&#x201d;</p><p>By now it had grown completely dark. Fritz and Marie, thoroughly pressed together, did not dare say another word. It sounded as if rustling wings encircled them, and as if they could catch a very distant and very splendid music. A bright shine grazed the wall, and now the children knew that the Christ Child had flown away on radiant clouds, flown to other happy children.</p><p>At that moment, they heard a bright silvery chime: &#x201c;Klingling, klingling!&#x201d;</p><p>The doors burst open, and the radiance erupting into the large room was so deep that the children cried out: &#x201c;Ah! Ah!&#x201d; and they halted on the threshold, petrified.</p><p>But then Mama and Papa stepped in, took the children by the hand, and said: &#x201c;Come on, come on, you dear children, and look what the Holy Christ has brought you.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Gifts</p><p>I TURN TO YOU, GENTLE READER OR LISTENER&#x2014;Fritz, Theodor, Emst&#x2014;or whatever your name may be, and I picture you vividly at your last Christmas table, which is richly adorned with gorgeous, multicolored presents. You will then envisage how the children halted, in silence and with shining eyes. You will then envision how, after a while, Marie cried out with a deep sigh: &#x201c;Ah! How beautiful! Ah! How beautiful!&#x201d; And Fritz tried out his caprioles, which were very successful. But the children had to have been devout and well behaved the entire year, for never had they had such splendid and such beautiful gifts as this time.</p><p></p></p><h2>Barron&#39;s ACT</h2><p>This all-new set of test-preparation flash cards is designed to give prospective ACT test-takers the help they&#39;re looking for.

And trying to brush his teeth turns into a battle. We must be doing something wrong!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes I wonder if any sound comes out when I open my mouth. My five-year-old doesn&#x2019;t seem to hear anything I say to her. She won&#x2019;t listen to me at all. Is she always going to act like this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t wait for our son to begin talking, but now we can&#x2019;t get him to stop. He has figured out that he can prolong any conversation by saying, &#x2018;Guess what?&#x2019; He is our delight and despair, in almost equal measure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought it was cute when my three-year-old could use her little fingers to find all kinds of things on my cellphone. Now that she is five, she wants to play with the phone all the time and has terrible tantrums when I take it away from her. What can we do?&#x201d;<br><br>As you will discover in the pages that follow (or as you may already realize), ages three to six are busy, hectic years for young children&#x2014;and for their parents and caregivers. Researchers tell us that human beings have more physical energy at the age of three than at any other time in their life span&#x2014;certainly more than their weary parents. An inborn drive for emotional, cognitive, and physical development is urging them to explore the world around them; they&#x2019;re acquiring and practicing social skills and entering the world outside the protected haven of the family. And preschoolers have ideas&#x2014;lots of them&#x2014;about how that world should operate. Their ideas, along with their urges to experiment and explore, often do not mesh with their parents&#x2019; and caregivers&#x2019; expectations.<br><br>What you will discover in the chapters ahead may be a bit different from what you grew up with. It may help to know that Positive Discipline is evidence-based, fits with what we know about children&#x2019;s growth and development and the latest brain research, and is designed to provide practical, effective tools for understanding and nurturing your child.<br><br>Adler and Dreikurs: Pioneers in Parenting<br><br>Positive Discipline is based on the work of Alfred Adler and his colleague Rudolf Dreikurs. Adler was a Viennese psychiatrist and a contemporary of Sigmund Freud&#x2014;but he and Freud disagreed about almost everything. Adler believed that human behavior is motivated by a desire for belonging, significance, connection, and worth, which are influenced by our early decisions about ourselves, others, and the world around us. Recent research validates Adler&#x2019;s theories and tells us that children are hardwired from birth to seek connection with others, and that children who feel a sense of connection to their families, schools, and communities are less likely to misbehave (other than the age-appropriate power struggles as children seek to discover who they are separate from their parents and caregivers). Adler believed that everyone has equal rights to dignity and respect (including children), ideas that found a warm reception in America, a land he adopted as his own after immigrating here.<br><br>Rudolf Dreikurs, a Viennese psychiatrist and student of Adler&#x2019;s who came to the United States in 1937, was a passionate advocate of the need for dignity and mutual respect in all relationships&#x2014;including the family. He wrote books about teaching and parenting that are still widely read, including the classic Children: The Challenge.<br><br>As you will learn, what many people mislabel as &#x201c;misbehavior&#x201d; in preschoolers has more to do with emotional, physical, and cognitive development and age-appropriate behavior. Through Positive Discipline, parents and caregivers can respond to this misbehavior with loving guidance that helps children develop the characteristics and life skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.<br><br>What Is Positive Discipline?<br><br>Positive Discipline is effective with preschoolers because it is different from conventional discipline. It has nothing to do with punishment (which many people think is synonymous with discipline) and everything to do with teaching&#x2014;which begins with modeling the skills and values you hope your children will develop. This raises a question: &#x201c;Is Positive Discipline for me or for my children?&#x201d; The answer is both&#x2014;but you first.<br><br>To be effective, you must model what you want to teach. It does not make sense to expect a child to be respectful if you are not respectful. Punishment is not respectful. You cannot expect a child to control his or her behavior when you don&#x2019;t control your own. Does this mean you have to be perfect? No. A foundational principle of Positive Discipline, as Dreikurs taught over and over, is to have the courage to be imperfect and to see mistakes as opportunities to learn. It&#x2019;s a gift to your children (and to yourself) when you can say, &#x201c;You made a mistake. Fantastic. Let&#x2019;s explore what you can learn from this and how you can find solutions to fix the mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>As your child matures and becomes more skilled, you will be able to involve him in the process of finding solutions and setting limits. He can practice critical-thinking skills, feel more capable, and learn to use his power and autonomy in useful ways&#x2014;to say nothing of feeling more motivated to follow solutions and limits he has helped create. The principles of Positive Discipline will help you build a relationship of love and respect with your child and will help you live and solve problems together for many years to come.<br><br>The building blocks of Positive Discipline include:<br><br>� Mutual respect. Parents and caregivers model firmness by respecting themselves and the needs of the situation; they model kindness by respecting the needs and humanity of the child.<br><br>� Understanding the belief behind behavior. All human behavior has a purpose. You will be far more effective at changing your child&#x2019;s behavior when you understand why it is happening. (Children start creating the beliefs that form their personality from the day they are born.) Dealing with the belief is as important (if not more so) than dealing with the behavior.<br><br>� Effective communication. Parents and children (even young ones) can learn to listen well and use respectful words to ask for what they need. Parents will learn that children &#x201c;hear&#x201d; better when they are invited to think and participate instead of being told what to think and do. And parents will learn how to model the listening they expect from their children.<br><br>� Understanding a child&#x2019;s world. Children go through different stages of development. By learning about the developmental tasks your child faces and taking into account other variables such as birth order, temperament, and the presence (or absence) of social and emotional skills, your child&#x2019;s behavior becomes easier to understand. When you understand your child&#x2019;s world, you can choose better responses to her behavior.<br><br>� Discipline that teaches rather than punishes. Effective discipline teaches valuable social and life skills, and is neither permissive nor punitive.<br><br>� Focusing on solutions instead of punishment. Blame never solves problems. At first you, as the parent, will decide how to approach challenges and problems. But as your child grows and develops, you will learn to work together to find respectful, helpful solutions to the challenges you face, from spilled juice to bedtime woes.<br><br>� Encouragement. Encouragement celebrates effort and improvement, not just success, and helps children develop confidence in their own abilities. Encouragement is also the foundation for creating a sense of belonging&#x2014;the primary need of all children (and adults).<br><br>� Children do better when they feel better. Where did parents get the crazy idea that in order to &#x201c;make&#x201d; children do better, parents should make them feel shame, humiliation, or even pain? Children are more motivated to cooperate, learn new skills, and offer affection and respect when they feel encouraged, connected, and loved.<br><br>� Connection before correction. It is always the relationship that matters most. When your child feels a sense of belonging and significance and your connection to each other is strong, it becomes much easier to understand feelings and behavior, and to find solutions together.<br><br>� Contribution. If a child only feels connection without a sense of contribution, that child may develop an entitled or &#x201c;Me first!&#x201d; attitude. Your child is more likely to learn the skills and character qualities you desire when you find ways for her to help you and others, and to contribute to her home, classroom, and community.</p><h2>Sales and Service for the Wine Professional</h2><p>In the new edition of Sales and Service for the Wine Professional Brian Julyan provides a comprehensible and in-depth coverage of the wine industry and continues to promote the highest standards of wine service and product knowledge.

The books are illustrated with 19th century-plates and incorporate revisions by experts in the light of subsequent research.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>Theology and the Scientific Imagination from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century</h2><p>This pioneering work in the history of science, which originated in a series of three Gauss Seminars given at Princeton University in 1984, demonstrated how the roots of the scientific revolution lay in medieval scholasticism. A work of intellectual history addressing the metaphysical foundations of modern science, Theology and the Scientific Imagination raised and transformed the level of discourse on the relations of Christianity and science. Amos Funkenstein was one of the world&#39;s most distinguished scholars of Jewish history, medieval intellectual history, and the history of science. Called a genius and Renaissance man by his academic colleagues, Funkenstein was legendary for his ability to recite long literary passages verbatim and from memory in Latin, German, French, Hebrew, Yiddish, and Greek decades after he had last read them. A winner of the coveted Israel Prize for History, Funkenstein was born and raised in Palestine and received his Ph.D. in history and philosophy at the Free University of Berlin in 1965, as one of the first Jewish students to receive a doctorate in Germany after World War II. Author of seven books and more than fifty scholarly articles in four languages, Funkenstein was at the height of his powers in Theology and the Scientific Imagination, which ends with the author&#39;s influential discernment of the seventeenth century&#39;s &#34;unprecedented fusion&#34; of scientific and religious language. It remains a fundamental text to historians and philosophers of science.</p><p>"<i>Theology and the Scientific Imagination</i> should be read by every historian of science. I can also hardly imagine a philosopher of science who would remain indifferent to the roots of modern thinking. The reading of this book gives one a deep intellectual pleasure: to follow adventures in ideas is like experiencing the adventures themselves."<b>---Michael Heller, <i>The Review of Metaphysics</i></b><br><br>"[This work] promises to raise the level and transform the nature of discourse on the relations of Christianity and science. . . . a bold study of ideas . . . bristling with insight and perceptive reinterpretation of familiar episodes in the history of natural philosophy."<b>---David C. Lindberg, <i>Journal of the History of Medicine</i></b><br><br>"Funkenstein's powerful essay belongs to that genre of intellectual history which has addressed itself to . . . the metaphysical foundations of modern science. . . . Liberation from naive conceptions of historical continuity gives Funkenstein leave to concentrate on a finely nuanced exegesis of those philosophers who fall within his purview. The result is a work of discernment and distinction."<b>---J. H. Brooke, <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b></p><h2>Among the Gentiles: Greco-Roman Religion and Christianity (The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library)</h2><p><p><b>An acclaimed scholar presents a bold new interpretation of the relationship between Greco-Roman religion and Christianity.</b><br><br> The question of Christianity&#x2019;s relation to the other religions of the world is more pertinent and difficult today than ever before. While Christianity&#x2019;s historical failure to appreciate or actively engage Judaism is notorious, Christianity&#x2019;s even more shoddy record with respect to &#x201c;pagan&#x201d; religions is less understood. Christians have inherited a virtually unanimous theological tradition that thinks of paganism in terms of demonic possession, and of Christian missions as a rescue operation that saves pagans from inherently evil practices.&nbsp;</p><p>In undertaking this fresh inquiry into early Christianity and Greco-Roman paganism, Luke Timothy Johnson begins with a broad definition of religion as a way of life organized around convictions and experiences concerning ultimate power. In the tradition of William James&#x2019;s <i>Variety of Religious Experience</i>, he identifies four distinct ways of being religious: religion as participation in benefits, as moral transformation, as transcending the world, and as stabilizing the world. Using these criteria as the basis for his exploration of Christianity and paganism, Johnson finds multiple points of similarity in religious sensibility.</p><p>Christianity&#x2019;s failure to adequately come to grips with its first pagan neighbors, Johnson asserts, inhibits any effort to engage positively with adherents of various world religions.&nbsp; This thoughtful and passionate study should help break down the walls between Christianity and other religious traditions.</p></p><p><b>Luke Timothy Johnson</b> is the R.

Meeks, author of <i>First Urban Christians</i><br><br> (Wayne A.

Those who don't often work with numbers have an even tougher time trying to put them into words. For instance, scientists and policy analysts learn to calculate and interpret numbers, but not how to explain them to a general audience. Students learn about gathering data and using statistical techniques, but not how to write about their results. And readers struggling to make sense of numerical information are often left confused by poor explanations. Many books elucidate the art of writing, but books on writing about numbers are nonexistent.<br><br>Until now. Here, Jane Miller, an experienced research methods and statistics teacher, gives writers the assistance they need. <i>The Chicago Guide to Writing about Numbers</i> helps bridge the gap between good quantitative analysis and good expository writing. Field-tested with students and professionals alike, this book shows writers how to think about numbers during the writing process.<br><br>Miller begins with twelve principles that lay the foundation for good writing about numbers. Conveyed with real-world examples, these principles help writers assess and evaluate the best strategy for representing numbers.

A few newer ones, such as Sun-Dried Tomato and Olive Bread, also qualify.

From Doug Flutie's "Hail Mary" pass to Lance Armstrong's record-breaking climb of Alp d'Huez to David Beckham's astounding ability to bend a soccer kick, we marvel and wonder, "How did they do that?" Well, physics professor John Eric Goff has the answers.</p><p>This tour of the wide world of sports uses some of the most exhilarating feats in recent athletic history to make basic physics concepts accessible and fun. Goff discusses the science behind American football, soccer, cycling, skating, diving, long jumping, and a host of other competitive sports. Using elite athletes such as Greg Louganis and Bob Beamon as starting points, he explains in clear, lively language the basic physical properties involved in amazing and everyday athletic endeavors. Accompanied by illustrations and mathematical equations, each chapter builds on knowledge imparted in earlier portions of the book to provide a firm understanding of the concepts involved.</p><p>Fun, witty, and imbued throughout with admiration for the simple beauty of physics, <i>Gold Medal Physics</i> is sure to inspire readers to think differently about the next sporting event they watch.</p></p><p><p><b>John Eric Goff</b> is an associate professor of physics and chair of the physics department at Lynchburg College.</p>Mathematically minded readers who've always wondered how great athletes do what they do will learn from Goff how to view the world of sports through the lens of physics. Goff, a sports enthusiast and Lynchburg College physics professor, is more than comfortable analyzing a variety of feats of physical prowess, such as a spectacular play in the final seconds of a legendary 1982 Stanford-Berkeley college football game. After analyzing that play with its five lateral passes, Goff moves on to stage 16 of Lance Armstrong's 2004 Tour de France win, and a record-breaking long jump by Bob Beamon at the 1968 Summer Olympics. While the discussion of the mechanics of angular momentum using the spins and rotations of ice skating and diving (Katarina Witt and Greg Louganis, respectively) will be familiar to nearly anyone who's read a physics textbook, Goff surprises with chapters on how to bend it like Beckham, win at sumo wrestling, and use statistics and probability to predict college football outcomes. Sports fans with a knowledge of geometry and trigonometry will enjoy Goff's cheerful revisiting of memorable athletic events. 70 illus. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Handsomely presented in facing-page Spanish and English, this volume, translated by National Book Award winner Clayton Eshleman, includes the groundbreaking collections <i>The Black Heralds </i>(1918), <i>Trilce </i>(1922), <i>Human Poems </i>(1939), and <i>Spain, Take This Cup from Me </i>(1939). <br><br>Vallejo's poetry takes the Spanish language to an unprecedented level of emotional rawness and stretches its grammatical possibilities. Striking against theology with the very rhetoric of the Christian faith, Vallejo's is a tragic vision&#x2015;perhaps the only one in the canon of Spanish-language literature&#x2015;in which salvation and sin are one and the same. This edition includes notes on the translation and a fascinating translation memoir that traces Eshleman's long relationship with Vallejo's poetry.

A tribute to the power of the imagination as it manifests through language in a world where meaning has always to be fought for and, as here, retrieved against the odds."&#x2015;Jerome Rothenberg, co-editor of <i>Poems for the Millennium</i><br><br>"Every great poet should be so lucky as to have a translator as gifted and heroic as Clayton Eshleman, who seems to have gotten inside Vallejo's poems and translated them from the inside out.

It may occur as our child struggles with a long division assignment. It could take place as he attempts to master a new Nintendo game. Or it might be uttered as he works at reading directions for a recipe or instructions on how to build a model airplane. Whenever it occurs, "I can't" language signals an "I can't" attitude toward learning and achieving. Often accompanied by a whiny tone, "I can't" words are connected to "I can't" thinking, "I can't" believing, and "I can't" behaviors. <p>How do you respond when one of your children looks up from his study table and verbalizes some version of "I can't do it?" What do you say? If you're like many of the participants who attend my parent seminars, you reply with words similar to, "Sure you can, come on, try." Parents believe that if children would just try, they'd eventually prove to themselves that they can. </p><p>"Sure you can, come on, try" sounds like helpful parent talk. It is not because, most often it doesn't work. Typically, children respond to our efforts to get them to try with, "I'm trying" or "I tried already." </p><p>What children and parents don't realize is that trying doesn't work. Only doing works. Anyone busy trying is not busy doing. Trying is often an excuse for giving up. </p><p>A strategic piece of parent talk to replace the "Come on, try" language is "Act as if ... ." The next time one of your children delivers a whiny rendition of "I can't" smile, look him in the eyes, speak from your heart, and give him these three words: "Act as if." </p><p>"Billy, act as if you can." "Mary, I want you to act as if you already know how to do this." "Just act as if you've done this before, Shannon." </p><p>After you've delivered your new parent talk, step back and go to another room. Watch from a distance as your child begins doing. I predict that you'll be pleasantly surprised by the effect of "Act as if." It won't work every time with every child, but it could be the most important phrase you add to your parent talk repertoire this year. </p><p>With young children, "Pretend" or "Play like you can" work well. "Fake it" and "How could you do this if you did know?" are effective alternatives with older children. </p><p>Sometimes you say "Act as if" and your child starts doing the task incorrectly. Don't worry. You can correct incorrect doing, whereas it's impossible to correct someone who is not doing anything. "Act as if" gets children doing. You can adjust from there. Until they start doing, corrective guidance and feedback are impossible. </p><p>"Act as if" is more effective than "trying" because trying implies struggle, while "acting as if" is more playful and less serious. Some children won't try because if they don't succeed they consider themselves a failure. If they "pretend" or "act as if," no stigma or failure is attached. </p><p>Not sure "act as if" will work with your children? Not sure you can use if effectively? Why not "act as if" you can?</p></p><h2>The Phantom Story</h2><p>An illustrated study of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom, the classic American jet fighter, covering its 35-year span of military service.

Original.</p><p><i>Writing from Life</i> is from the Tarcher/Putnam series of Inner Work Books, which also spawned <i>The Artist's Way</i>.

You will have written about (and thus discovered how you feel about) your family and soul mates, journeys you have taken, places you have called home, and causes that motivate you. Inspiring quotes, mostly by women, are strewn throughout, and each chapter concludes with a meditation and suggestions for celebrating its completion.<b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley.

Combining the best classroom practices and research on teaching reading and language acquisition, Mary Cappellini integrates effective reading instruction with effective language instruction. Through the framework of a balanced reading program, she emphasizes the importance of constantly listening for and assessing children's language and reading strategies during read aloud, shared reading, guided reading, and independent reading, including literature circles.Mary plans and demonstrates whole-class, small-group, and individual reading instruction using a model of "reading to, with, and by children" with fiction and nonfiction texts. She works in the primary and upper grades with children at all stages of English language development and at all developmental reading levels. With on-going assessments based on those interactions, she shows how to plan for more effective instruction. Mary constantly questions and discusses whether the child needs more support in language development or in developing reading strategies, breaking down assumptions that equate a low level of English proficiency with a lack of reading strategies, or English language fluency with accomplished reading skills.Through the use of wonderful literature, and by maintaining a focus on the children's strengths, needs, prior knowledge, and interests, Mary constantly challenges students as they develop their fluency in English while becoming fluent readers.<ul>Included in this text are: <li>how to set up an environment that will allow all English language learners to succeed;</li> <li>the stages of English language proficiency and stages of reading development&#x2014;how they compare and how to use them to assess and plan for individual children;</li> <li>A focus on tapping into children's prior knowledge in their primary language while teaching reading in English and using Spanish/English cognates to help develop academic language;</li> <li>a collection of in-depth lessons and mini-lessons based on children's language proficiency and reading strategy needs with ongoing assessment, teacher reflection, and with an emphasis on choosing the right books to match their reading and language level;</li> <li>how to manage numerous guided reading groups with children of all stages of reading and language proficiency;</li> <li>thematic planning, with sample units for primary and upper grades, to support academic language and meet content standards;</li> <li>ideas for literacy evenings, school tours, and other events to involve parents with the learning community;</li> <li>extensive resources: numerous forms and checklists&#x2014;observation sheets, planning sheets, literature response sheets, focus sheets for shared and guided reading, and more. Also included are lists of books for read alouds, shared reading, and thematic units, and lists of recommended guided reading series appropriate for English language learners.</li></ul><i>Balancing Reading and Language Learning</i>&nbsp;provides the strategies proven to be effective in a balanced reading program, while at the same time valuing the native culture and first-language skills of the English language learner. Regardless of how many or how few ELL students a teacher has, this invaluable resource helps them meet the challenges and reap the rewards of teaching children to read as they learn the language.</p><p><p>Mary Cappellini is a Bilingual Educational Consultant and a published children's book author who has worked in education for over 30 years. A teacher at heart, she enjoys engaging teachers in reflections and classroom demonstration lessons in her staff development with schools across the country. She works in large urban districts, lectures at prestigious universities, including Columbia's Teachers College, speaks at national conferences, and plans long-term staff development for smaller school districts with bulging ELL populations.</p><p>"I am hoping that my book, and the staff development I do, helps teachers think more deeply about how their children are developing as speakers as well as readers and writers. We cannot separate language from reading -- they are linked, and therefore, our instruction and our assessment of reading and language development must be linked," Mary explains.</p><p>Besides her current role as an educational consultant, Mary taught in K-5 classrooms, was a bilingual reading resource teacher and a mentor teacher in the inner city schools of Santa Ana, California, an ESL and 5th grade teacher at the American school in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and taught ESL to adults at Community Colleges as well as worked as an adjunct professor and part time lecturer at California State Universities and UCs.</p><p>A native of California, Mary still lives in Orange County where she grew up. Although she lived most of her life in California, she also lived in Spain and in Argentina, where she met her husband. Her bilingual family includes three daughters, and she says: "We travel as often as we can, visiting families on two continents." Besides consulting and traveling, she continues to write children's books in both English and Spanish and volunteers teaching ESL to recent immigrants in an after school youth program at Save Our Youth (SOY), a nonprofit in Costa Mesa, California, where she also serves as a board member.</p></p><h2>A guide to drawing</h2><p>Truly a classic, A GUIDE TO DRAWING, Fifth Edition builds on the idea that mastery of traditional skills is fundamental to expressive drawing. It allows beginning, advanced and specialized drawing students to master basic skills and to use them creatively, whether working under the direction of an instructor or on their own. Perspective receives the most systematic and thorough treatment available in any drawing textbook. Nearly 400 master drawings (with 13 color plates) represent many periods, techniques and subject matters, filling the need to integrate art history with studio experience. Over 170 valuable studio projects promote understanding of the material, technical comptence, and control and confidence in both beginning and advanced students. Sketchbook activities in most chapters encourage a spontaneous approach to drawing and seeing when students are working outside the structured classroom or studio environment. Illustrations for both the part and chapter openers by Duane Wakeham.</p><p>David L. Faber is an American master printmaker and Professor of Art and Head of Printmaking at Wake Forest University where he has taught since 1984. He is the lead-author of A GUIDE TO DRAWING. Faber has had 22 solo exhibitions of his work since 1976 and has exhibited in numerous group and invitational exhibitions since 1974. He has lectured and worked as a guest artist in Canada, England, Germany, Italy, and South America. Some of his most notable works include: the Aberdeen Headlands series of chine colle monotypes; the Holstein Poetry-Catenary Curve series of intaglio prints; Saint Anna of Silos and Air; the Germans in Brazil series of lithographs produced in Sao Paulo, Brazil at Ymagos Atelier; the Red Holstein Factor series of plaster-cast intaglio prints; and the Piano Sheaves series of intaglio prints. Among Faber&#39;s most practiced printmaking techniques are intaglio, lithography, monotype, and plaster-cast intaglio prints. He specializes in drypoint, engraving, mezzotint, and etching techniques. His prints are held in the permanent collections of The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The National Art Museum of the Ukraine in Kiev, The U.S. State Department, Washington, DC, and The American Bar Association, Chicago."The three greatest strengths of A GUIDE TO DRAWING are its attitude that drawing is a significant activity that is necessary to understanding the world both visually and conceptually, its clarity in explaining the complex issue of perspective, and its ability to communicate the reasons (historical, cultural, pragmatic or personal) why various drawing strategies exist. A fourth strength is the chapter-related drawing exercises that help to clarify--through drawing--the content of each chapter."<br><br>"A GUIDE TO DRAWING is the most comprehensive drawing text that I have seen. The content covers many subtle issues of drawing techniques, materials and attitudes that are helpful for the beginning and advanced students as well as mature artists."</p><h2>Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in Counseling (4th Edition) (Merrill Counseling (Paperback))</h2><p><p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

While most available versions of these early Greek writings are rendered in prose, Hine's illuminating translations represent these early classics as they originally appeared, in verse. Since prose was not invented as a literary medium until well after Hesiod's time, presenting these works as poems more closely approximates not only the mechanics but also the melody of the originals.<br> <br> This volume includes Hesiod's <i>Works and Days</i> and <i>Theogony</i>, two of the oldest non-Homeric poems to survive from antiquity. <i>Works and Days</i> is in part a farmer's almanac&#x2014;filled with cautionary tales and advice for managing harvests and maintaining a good work ethic&#x2014;and <i>Theogony</i> is the earliest comprehensive account of classical mythology&#x2014;including the names and genealogies of the gods (and giants and monsters) of Olympus, the sea, and the underworld. Hine brings out Hesiod's unmistakable personality; Hesiod's tales of his escapades and his gritty and persuasive voice not only give us a sense of the author's own character but also offer up a rare glimpse of the everyday life of ordinary people in the eighth century BCE.<br> <br> In contrast, the Homeric Hymns are more distant in that they depict aristocratic life in a polished tone that reveals nothing of the narrators' personalities. These hymns (so named because they address the deities in short invocations at the beginning and end of each) are some of the earliest examples of <i>epyllia</i>, or short stories in the epic manner in Greek.<br> <br> This volume unites Hine's skillful translations of the <i>Works of Hesiod</i> and the Homeric Hymns&#x2014;along with Hine's rendering of the mock-Homeric epic <i>The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice</i>&#x2014;in a stunning pairing of these masterful classics.<br></p></p><p><p><b>Daryl Hine</b> is an award-winning poet and translator.

As she unfolds the story of Undine Spragg, from New York to Europe, Wharton affords us a detailed glimpse of what might be called the interior d�cor of this America and its nouveau riche fringes. Through a heroine who is as vain, spoiled, and selfish as she is irresistibly fascinating, and through a most intricate and satisfying plot that follows Undine's marriages and affairs, she conveys a vision of social behavior that is both supremely informed and supremely disenchanted.&nbsp;This edition features a new introduction and explanatory notes and reset text.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Through her heroine, the beautiful and ruthless Undine Spragg, a spoiled heiress who looks to her next materialistic triumph as her latest conquest throws himself at her feet, Edith Wharton presents a startling, satiric vision of social behavior in all its greedy glory. As Undine moves from America&#39;s heartland to Manhattan, and then to Paris, Wharton&#39;s critical eye leaves no social class unscathed.</p><h2>The Scarlet Letter (Volume 15) (Knickerbocker Classics, 15)</h2><p><p><b>Delve into <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature.</b><br><br> In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, <b>a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people</b>.

There was a dearth of comprehensive scientific literature on the subject until the publication of this volume. Geared toward advanced undergraduates in physics or engineering, it features remarkable clarity and a minimum of mathematical notation, making it accessible to nonspecialists and useful as a teaching resource or for self-study. <br>Dr. Uman, whose own work has contributed greatly to understanding the physics of lightning, presents a general introduction to lightning phenomena and terminology, lightning photography, electrical and magnetic field measurements, and current measurements. Additional topics include lightning spectroscopy and thunder, a wealth of new and detailed analyses of the latest data, and reviews of theories regarding the discharge process from the special vantage point of a scientist well-versed in plasma physics. Five appendices bring recent research up to date, covering such phenomena as bead and ball lightning and reviewing experimental data and modeling. This authoritative exposition of the many physical phenomena associated with lightning is the only inexpensive single-volume presentation on the subject.</p><p></p><h2>Magic Prague</h2><p>This unusual, distinctive book is a glowing, theatrical blend of history, travelogue, fictional sketch, art and literary criticism, and personal essay. Angelo Ripellino goes beyond the tourist clich� of Prague and brings out the mystery, ambiguity, gloom, lethargy, and hidden fascination of the city of the Vltava. He uses melodrama and ghost stories, as well as tales from the enchanted road and the risqu� barroom to relate the sorcery of the Bohemian capital in a wonderful mix of fact and fiction.<br><br>As the book opens, Kafka and Hasek are still stalking the streets of the Old Town. In the second section we are in the seventeenth century, with its emphasis on the occult. Traveling on, we move through Prague's bordellos, theaters, ghetto, alchemists' laboratories, and caf�s, accompanied by Rudolph II, Apollinaire, and Czech dadaists. The result of this imaginary guided tour is a deeper knowledge of the city than any ordinary guidebook can provide as well as an exhilarating introduction to Czech culture.</p><p>Angelo Maria Ripellino (1923-1978) was for many years Professor of Russian Language and Lecturer in Czech Language and Literature at the University of Rome.Although Prague is renowned for its beauty and is conveniently located in the center of Europe, fascism and communism have kept it off most American tourist itineraries for more than half a century. Capitalism is quickly returning it to every tourist's list. Levine, an American who lived in Prague while writing this guidebook, includes detailed information on transportation, accommodations, eating, shopping, and entertainment, plus interesting (and sometimes useful) cultural anecdotes and historical facts. Although the focus is on Prague, 15 day trips outside the city are also described; the book could serve as a guide to the new Czech Republic as well as to its capital. Following the "Maverick Guide" philosophy, Levine's writing style is colloquial and more opinionated than that of some other travel series. Highly recommended. In contrast, Ripellino, formerly of the University of Rome, presents a blend of history, art, literary criticism, and fantasy designed to relate not just facts about the city on the Vltava but to explore its essence as well. Ripellino's writing is dense and discursive, which may initially confuse readers, especially those without much prior knowledge of Czech history and culture. The bewildering array of names and places begins on page 1. To complicate matters further, some of these people and places may not exist, since the book has a fictional element.

Objectivity, Kenner claims, was a modern invention, and one that the modernists--Joyce foremost among them--found problematic. Accessible and enjoyable, <i>Joyce's Voices</i> is what so much criticism is not: an aid to better understanding--and enjoying more fully--the work of one of the world's greatest writers.</p><p>Hugh Kenner (1923-2003) was one of America&#39;s great literary critics. He wrote on a range of subjects that includes Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and geodesic domes."The volume is easy to handle and a delight to read. And Kenner's leaping wit, his metaphors, his transitions from insight to insight, his lively attention to Joyce's invention these qualities make it difficult, if you pick it up one evening, not to finish it before turning off the light." --Donald Hall, <i>National Review</i><br><br>"Kenner's work is an achievement of a polymath: it ranges from Jonathan Swift to Flaubert, and from Dickens to T. S. Eliot, circling around its two main concerns: Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> and the death of objectivity as a privileged style in modern literature." --<i>Choice</i><br><br>"As always, Kenner is original, provocative, stimulating, occasionally perverse, and immensely readable. . . .

She has taught in both physical and occupational therapy programs throughout the United States. At the time of her retirement she was professor and chair of the Department of Physical Therapy at the University of the Pacific and played a major role in its evolution to granting a Doctorate of Physical Therapy to its graduates. After retirement she was made an emeritus professor with all the honors that brings. Throughout her professional career and throughout the world, she taught courses, which combined theories of central nervous system function, movement science, and evidence-based practice into an integrated approach to analyzing individuals with central nervous system dysfunction creating functional movement problems. Her love of clinical practice and analyzing movement problems has driven her to question the &#x201c;why&#x2019;s&#x201d; behind patients&#x2019; functional restrictions. Similarly, she has studied how our limbic, cognitive, and belief systems affect the interactions between the client and the therapist. She has been the primary editor of the textbook Neurological Rehabilitation, currently in its Sixth Edition and translated into many different languages throughout the world. She has received numerous awards at the local, state, and national levels within the American Physical Therapy Association and was made a Catherine Worthingham Fellow in 2003. Her respect for the profession of physical therapy and the 2 educated clinicians&#x2014;the physical therapist and the physical therapist assistant&#x2014;has been demonstrated by her commitment to the responsibilities and services both professionals play in the delivery of physical therapy services throughout the world. It is her belief that physical therapy can and should play a unique role in the delivery of services for individuals with functional movement problems whether those problems arise from disease or pathology or from everyday life experiences. Optimal quality of life is defined by each individual, and it is the therapist&#x2019;s role to help that person regain as much of that quality available. <br><br><b>Rolando T.

Dr. Lazaro has coauthored many research articles and chapters for a variety of textbooks. He is coeditor of both this book and the Sixth Edition of Neurological Rehabilitation. His publications demonstrate his commitment to not only teaching but also contributing to the body of knowledge known as evidence-based practice within and outside the profession of physical therapy. Dr. Lazaro was awarded a Fulbright Senior Scholarship to the Philippines from June to November 2013. Dr. Lazaro is currently an associate professor and co-chair of the Department of Physical Therapy at Samuel Merritt University in Oakland, California.

In <i>Profanations</i>, Agamben has assembled for the first time some of his most pivotal essays on photography, the novel, and film. A meditation on memory and oblivion, on what is lost and what remains, <i>Profanations </i>proves yet again that Agamben is one of the most provocative writers of our time. In ten essays, Agamben ponders a series of literary and philosophical problems: the relation among genius, ego, and theories of subjectivity; the problem of messianic time as explicated in both images and lived experience; parody as a literary paradigm; and the potential of magic to provide an ethical canon. </p><p>The range of topics and themes addressed here attest to the creativity of Agamben's singular mode of thought and his persistent concern with the act of witnessing, sometimes futile, sometimes earth-shattering. &#x201c;In Praise of Profanity,&#x201d; the central essay of this short but dense book, confronts the question of profanity as the crucial political task of the moment. An act of resistance to every form of separation, the concept of profanation reorients perceptions of how power, consumption, and use interweave to produce an urgent political modality and desire: to profane the unprofanable. Agamben not only provides a new and potent theoretical model but describes it with a writerly style that itself forges inescapable links among literature, politics, and philosophy.</p></p><p>Giorgio Agamben is one of the leading figures in Italian philosophy. He is the author of <i>Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life</i>; <i>Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive</i>; <i>Profanations</i>; <i>The Signature of All Things: On Method</i> (the last three published by Zone Books), and other books.<p>Whether this will be your first, fourth, or fourteenth experience reading essays by Giorgio Agamben, you will find his most recent collectiom. <i>Profanations</i>, to be of enormous use.</p>&#x2015;<i>Rain Taxi</i></p><h2>Don&#x2019;t Accept Me as I am: Helping &#x201c;Retarded&#x201d; People to Excel</h2><p>Suggests a method designed to help raise the IQ&#39;s of the mentally retarded, and discusses the concept of mediated learning</p><p>The changing definition of what constitutes intelligence and the trend away from conventional IQ testing find dynamic expression in this ground-breaking report by Israeli psychologists Feuerstein and Rand and University of Minnesota professor Rynders. The authors, viewing intelligence as a plastic that can be molded, argue that retardation can be modified.

The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study.<br> <em>Native American Music in Eastern North America</em> is one of the first books to explore the contemporary musical landscape of indigenous North Americans in the north and east. It shows how performance traditions of Native North Americans have been influenced by traditional social values and cultural histories, as well as by encounters and exchanges with other indigenous groups and with newcomers from Europe and Africa. Drawing on her extensive fieldwork and on case studies from several communities--including the Iroquois, the Algonquian-speaking nations of the Atlantic seaboard, and the Inuit of the far north--author Beverley Diamond discusses intertribal celebrations, popular music projects, dance, art, and film. She also considers how technology has mediated present-day cultural communication and how traditional ideas about social roles and gender identities have been negotiated through music.<br> Enhanced by accounts of local performances, interviews with tribal elders and First Nations performers, vivid illustrations, and hands-on listening activities, <em>Native American Music in Eastern North America</em> provides a captivating introduction to this under-examined topic. It is packaged with an 80-minute audio CD containing twenty-six examples of the music discussed in the book, including several rare recordings.

Buildings fulfilled various roles in Monet&#x2019;s canvases; some are chiefly compositional devices while others throw into sharp contrast the forms of man-made construction against the irregularity of nature, or suggest the absent presence of humans. The theme was both central and consistent over five decades of his 60-year career.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written by a renowned expert on Impressionism, this book covers Monet&#x2019;s representations of historical buildings, inner cities, beach resorts, railway bridges and stations, suburban housing, and busy harbors&#x2014;subjects spanning northern France, the Mediterranean, and the cities of Rouen, London, and Venice.&nbsp; In addition to 75 great paintings by Monet, this thematic, picture-led book includes a wealth of comparative material, such as postcards, posters, original travel photography, and rarely seen aerial photography that sets Monet&#x2019;s work firmly in its historical, cultural, and social framework.</p><p>This beautiful book is the first to focus on Monet&#39;s work through his representation of architecture.<b>Richard Thomson</b> is Watson Gordon Professor of Fine Art at the University of Edinburgh.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Frederic Church</h2><p>The life of landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church (1826 1900) encompassed an expansive period in United States history, when the nation&#x2019;s commercial, diplomatic, cultural, and scientific achievements blossomed. This lavishly illustrated book the only comprehensive study of the artist available describes Church&#x2019;s life and career and details the ways in which the artist played a part in America&#x2019;s development during the nineteenth century. John K. Howat, a distinguished scholar of American landscape painting, discusses the many talents of Frederic Church while also explaining the rich complexities of his major works.<p></p>One of Thomas Cole&#x2019;s illustrious pupils at an early age, Church became a key figure associated with&nbsp; the Hudson River School. His adventurous international travels and the paintings that resulted from his expeditions brought him far-reaching attention, and his pictures often commanded record-breaking sums. Church&#x2019;s friendships and interests religion, history, literature, music, architecture, agriculture, and science as well as his skills as a crafty entrepreneur are explored. Beautiful reproductions of Church&#x2019;s extraordinary home <i>Olana, </i>which one can visit today in eastern New York, are also featured.<p></p>For admirers of the Hudson River School, American landscape painting, and the history of nineteenth-century America, <i>Frederic Church </i>is an invaluable book to own.<p></p></p><p><b>John K.

"Small-Boat Sailing," was published in 1917 in <i>The Human Drift</i>, a collection of short stories and essays. London recounts his time at sea, including travels on fishing schooners and coal ships but mostly on small sailboats on San Francisco Bay. His description of the hard work, excitement, and thrill of handling a small boat in trouble on the water will be exhilarating to anyone who's experienced it or only wished they had. <br><br> This short work is part of Applewood's <i>American Roots</i> series, tactile mementos of American passions by some of America&#x2019;s most famous writers.</p><p>"I was not born a sailor, and I will never be one. However, the sea calls me, even though I am afraid of dying a watery death. As a boy, I built a kayak and took it for one short-lived adventure on an inlet on Long Island. I married a natural-born sailor: ready to tackle wind and tide with coolness, clarity, and calm. Jack London speaks to her but also to me. Can we ever be whoever we wish we could be? Are we all sailors, called back to something greater than ourselves?" &#x2015;Phil Zuckerman, Publisher</p><h2>Atlas of the Medieval World</h2><p>Forged in an age of faith and war and tempered by great statesmen, religious leaders and artists, medieval civilizations witnessed remarkable transformations. Far from being a homogeneous world of knights and castles, the era saw a multitude of contrasting and often competing cultures, many of which became the foundation stones for the emergence of modern societies. From the expansion of Islam across the Mediterranean to the appearance of centralized states and Christian monarchies, the <em>Atlas of the Medieval World</em> draws from new archival and archaeological evidence to reveal a period of astonishing cultural vibrancy and political diversity.<br> <br> Alongside stunning maps covering nearly a millennium of one of the most formative phases in history, hundreds of exquisite pictures of art and architecture accompany expertly written text edited by Rosamond McKitterick, Professor of Early Medieval History at Cambridge University to bring an extraordinary period to life as no reference has before. The Arab invasions of Europe, the empire of Charlemagne, the African kingdoms of Songhai and Mali, the Crusades, the Viking and Mongol invasions, the Delhi sultanate and the T'ang and Ming empires are just a few of the subjects explained in the <em>Atlas of the Medieval World</em>. What's more, cultural and economic trends such as the spread of literacy and the growth of towns receive equal attention alongside the emergence of kingdoms and the march of armies to form a comprehensive history of all major societies outside of the Americas during the Middle Ages.<br> <br></p><p><br><strong>Rosamond McKitterick</strong> is Professor of Early Medieval History, Cambridge University. She is also the editor of numerous books including <em>The Early Middle Ages: Europe 400-1000</em>, <em>The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 2</em>, and <em>The Frankish Kings and Culture in the Early Middle Ages</em>.<br>This exquisite atlas, published in England in 2003 as <i>The Times Medieval World</i>, traces a millennium of historical development ranging from the demise of the Roman Empire to the sixteenth century. Divided into three chronological parts, the volume covers political, religious, and cultural change all over the globe. Editor McKitterick is a leading medieval historian at Cambridge University. <p>There are close to 100 maps, ranging from photographs and reproductions of medieval maps to contemporary digitally produced maps illustrating migrations, trade routes, paths of marauding armies, ethnic and cultural distributions, and religious affiliations by place. Numerous lavish photographs of places, relics, and works of art are also included. Period quotations by various personages are liberally sprinkled throughout, ranging from King John's "Charter of Liberties for the English," a part of the <i>Magna Carta</i>, to the comments of Benjamin of Tudela, an itinerant, on Italian city-states. Many of the illustrations and maps occupy a full page, making them easy to read and dissect. It is difficult to overstate the elegance of these maps and reproductions, which, in combination with the text, give the atlas a truly extravagant, almost multimedia feel. For example, a portion of the "Towns and Trades in the Early Middle Ages" section depicts a town plan of the medieval commercial center of Dorestad in the upper left corner. Underneath this is a photograph of two Frankish swords, while the entire right-hand page is taken up with a detail photograph of a ninth-century Byzantine silk that had made its way to central Europe. Finally, a quotation from a letter written by Charlemagne to the King of Mercia is centered above the main text.</p><p>The progression of time is marked throughout the atlas by a time line running along the bottom of the pages. There are also an index, a glossary of historical terms and names, and a bibliography for each of the three parts of the atlas. Overall, this volume would be a welcome addition to academic, public, and high-school libraries. <i>Michael Tosko</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom in biology and economics, this generous and civic-minded behavior is widespread and cannot be explained simply by far-sighted self-interest or a desire to help close genealogical kin.</p><br><p> In <i>A Cooperative Species</i>, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis--pioneers in the new experimental and evolutionary science of human behavior--show that the central issue is not why selfish people act generously, but instead how genetic and cultural evolution has produced a species in which substantial numbers make sacrifices to uphold ethical norms and to help even total strangers.</p><br><p> The authors describe how, for thousands of generations, cooperation with fellow group members has been essential to survival. Groups that created institutions to protect the civic-minded from exploitation by the selfish flourished and prevailed in conflicts with less cooperative groups. Key to this process was the evolution of social emotions such as shame and guilt, and our capacity to internalize social norms so that acting ethically became a personal goal rather than simply a prudent way to avoid punishment.</p><br><p> Using experimental, archaeological, genetic, and ethnographic data to calibrate models of the coevolution of genes and culture as well as prehistoric warfare and other forms of group competition, <i>A Cooperative Species</i> provides a compelling and novel account of how humans came to be moral and cooperative.</p></p><p><p>"<i>A Cooperative Species</i> is a fresh and pioneering entry into the pivotal field of human social evolution."<b>--Edward O. Wilson, Harvard University</b></p><p>"In <i>A Cooperative Species</i>, Bowles and Gintis draw on their own research and teaching about understanding the complex human being in the context of diverse ways of organizing life. They show that humans can evolve cooperative strategies when they participate in groups that share long-term similar norms and are willing to sanction those that do not follow group agreements. An important book for all social scientists."<b>--Elinor Ostrom, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"Why we form cooperative societies is not hard to understand given all of the advantages we derive, but how we do it is far less understood. Humans have powerful selfish tendencies, but Bowles and Gintis are not of the school of thought that everything can be reduced to selfishness. They muster all of their expert knowledge to make clear that evolution has produced a species with a truly cooperative spirit and the means to encourage cooperation in others."<b>--Frans de Waal, author of <i>The Age of Empathy</i></b></p><p>"Bowles and Gintis stress that cooperation among individuals who are only distantly related is a critical distinguishing feature of the human species. They argue forcefully that the best explanation for such cooperation is altruism. Many will dispute this claim, but it deserves serious consideration."<b>--Eric Maskin, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><b>Samuel Bowles</b> heads the Behavioral Sciences Program at the Santa Fe Institute and teaches economics at the University of Siena. <b>Herbert Gintis</b> holds faculty positions at the Santa Fe Institute, Central European University, and the University of Siena.</p><h2>To Touch the Face of God: The Sacred, the Profane, and the American Space Program, 1957&#x2013;1975 (New Series in NASA History)</h2><p><p>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth..."</p><p>In 1968 the world watched as Earth rose over the moonscape, televised from the orbiting <i>Apollo 8</i> mission capsule. Radioing back to Houston on Christmas Eve, astronauts recited the first ten verses from the book of Genesis. In fact, many of the astronauts found space flight to be a religious experience. <i>To Touch the Face of God</i> is the first book-length historical study of the relationship between religion and the U.S. space program. </p><p>Kendrick Oliver explores the role played by religious motivations in the formation of the space program and discusses the responses of religious thinkers such as Paul Tillich and C. S. Lewis. Examining the attitudes of religious Americans, Oliver finds that the space program was a source of anxiety as well as inspiration. It was not always easy for them to tell whether it was a godly or godless venture.</p><p>Grounded in original archival research and the study of participant testimonies, this book also explores one of the largest petition campaigns of the post-war era. Between 1969 and 1975, more than eight million Americans wrote to NASA expressing support for prayer and bible-reading in space. Oliver&#x2019;s study is rigorous and detailed but also contemplative in its approach, examining the larger meanings of mankind&#x2019;s first adventures in "the heavens."</p></p><p><p>Was the space program the signature project of secular modernity or a symbol of humankind&#x2019;s perpetual quest for communion with God?</p><p><b>Kendrick Oliver</b> is a reader in American history in the Faculty of Humanities, University of Southampton, United Kingdom.</p></p><h2>Disease, Karma, and Healing: Spiritual-Scientific Enquiries into the Nature of the Human Being (CW 107) (The Collected Works of Rudolf Steiner, 107)</h2><p><b>18 lectures, Berlin, 1908&#x2013;1909 (CW 107)</b><br><br>According to Rudolf Steiner, illness comes to expression in the physical body, but mostly does not originate in it. Thus, a key to the physician&#x2019;s work is gaining insight into the whole nature&#x2015;the essential core being&#x2015;of an individual. Throughout this lecture course, Steiner draws our attention to the greater scope of the smallest phenomena&#x2015;even a seemingly insignificant headache. He sheds light on things we normally take for granted, such as the human capacity to laugh or cry. In the process, he broadens our vision of human existence. Moreover, &#x201c;mundane&#x201d; human experiences of forgetting and remembering are intrinsic to our humanity and have unsuspected moral and spiritual dimensions. <br><br>In these eighteen lectures, given weekly as part of an ongoing course on &#x201c;the whole field of spiritual science,&#x201d; Steiner elaborates in detail on the diverse interplay of the human constitution (the physical, etheric, and astral bodies and the &#x201c;I&#x201d;) in relation to rhythmic processes, developing consciousness, the history of human evolution, and our connection with the cosmos. Within this broad canvas, some of his themes acquire a very distinctive focus, including vivid accounts of the &#x201c;intimate history&#x201d; of Christianity, creating from &#x201c;nothing,&#x201d; the interior of the Earth, and health and illness. <br><br>Other topics include the nature of pain, suffering, pleasure, and bliss; the four human group souls of lion, bull, eagle, and humankind; the significance of the Ten Commandments; the nature of original sin; the deed of Christ and the adversarial powers of Lucifer, Ahriman, and the Asuras; evolution and involution; the Atlantean period; and even Nietzsche&#x2019;s final state of madness.<br><br><b>READ A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK BY BOBBY MATHERNE</b><br><br>This book is a translation from German of <i></i>(GA 107). Nine of the 18 lectures in this volume were previously translated and published as <i><b>The Being of Man and His Future Evolution</b></i>.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

It is a working tool written by a group of Christian educators to provide both a clear understanding of basic principles of Christian education and a practical guide for day-to-day administration of church education programs. After you study this book for the first time, you will want to keep it close at hand as a ready resource on Christian education administration.</p><p></p><h2>Transformative Lutheran Theologies: Feminist, Womanist, and Mujerista Perspectives</h2><p>The first of its kind, this book is a systematic representation of Lutheran feminist, womanist, and mujerista theologies: <i></i>systematic<i></i>, in that it addresses classical loci of systematic theology; <i></i>contemporary<i></i>, in that it is resoundingly constructive and relevant for the contemporary church; and <i></i>feminist<i></i>, in that the contributors write from a feminist perspective although they reflect a variety of positions within feminist discourse.<br>The contributors to this multi-authored work share a common commitment to Lutheran theology as a continual process of reform. Luther is a partner in the conversation because of his "theological insights and commitment to faithful criticism," which the writers seek to continue - not because his voice "settles a debate." The book focuses on central themes which Luther addressed and which are representative of Lutheranism today, including justification by grace through faith and Luther's theology of the cross. From diverse contexts, these Lutheran theologians, like Luther, seek reformation by "giving voice to new perspectives in theology that continue to transform the church and the world."</p><p>Mary J. Streufert is Director for Justice for Women, Church in Society Program Unit of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.&#34;A remarkable addition to the rich history of Lutheran theology. Not only have these theologians opened doors to fresh, new worlds of Lutheran thought, they&#39;ve done so in a way that honors the past by--extending it forward. I can&#39;t wait to use Transformative Lutheran Theologies in class. I&#39;ve been waiting twenty years for a text like this. Imagine teaching Luther&#39;s thought and placing it by side with these cutting-edge essays. Luther would no doubt be proud-- maybe even a bit envious.&#34; --Serene Jones, President and Roosevelt Professor of Systematic Theology</p><h2>Introduction to the Mechanics of a Continuous Medium</h2><p>A unified presentation of the concepts and general principles common to all branches of solid and fluid mechanics.</p><p></p><h2>The Land: Place As Gift, Promise, and Challenge in Biblical Faith (Overtures to Biblical Theology, 1)</h2><p>The land was one of the most vibrant symbols for the people of ancient Israel. In the land-gift, promise, and challenge-was found the physical source of Israel&#39;s fertility and life, and a place for the gathering of the hopes of the covenant people. In this careful treatment, Walter Brueggemann follows the development of his theme through the major blocks of Israel&#39;s traditions. The book provides a point of entrance both to the theology of the Old Testament and to aspects of the New Testament-even as it illuminates crucial issues of the contemporary scene. In this fully revised version, Brueggemann provides new insights, as well as updating the discussion, notes, and bibliography.</p><p>A classic work fully revised.Walter Brueggemann is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, Georgia.

He writes: "Though the structures and patterns of mathematics reflect the structure of, and resonate in, the human mind every bit as much as do the structures and patterns of music, human beings have developed no mathematical equivalent of a pair of ears. Mathematics can be seen only with the eyes of the mind." All of his books are attempts to get around this problem, to "try to communicate to others some sense of what it is we experience--some sense of the simplicity, the precision, the purity, and the elegance that give the patterns of mathematics their aesthetic value."<p> <i>Life by the Numbers</i>, Devlin's companion book to the PBS series of the same name, is heavily illustrated and soothingly low on equations. But as he says, wanting mathematics without abstract notation "is rather like saying that Shakespeare would be much easier to understand if it were written in simpler language."</p><p> <i>The Language of Mathematics</i> is Devlin's second iteration of the approach he used in <i>Mathematics: The Science of Patterns</i>. It covers all the same ground (and uses many of the same words) as the latter, but with fewer glossy pictures, sidebars, and references. Devlin has also added chapters on statistics and on mathematical patterns in nature. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><b>KEITH DEVLIN</b> is Dean of the School of Science at Saint Mary's College of California and Senior Researcher at Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and Information.

Edward Slingerland's analysis shows that wu-wei represents the most general of a set of conceptual metaphors having to do with a state of effortless ease and unself-consciousness. This concept of effortlessness, he contends, serves as a common ideal for both Daoist and Confucian thinkers. He also argues that this concept contains within itself a conceptual tension that motivates the development of early Chinese thought: the so-called "paradox of wu-wei," or the question of how one can consciously "try not to try."<br> <br> Methodologically, this book represents a preliminary attempt to apply the contemporary theory of conceptual metaphor to the study of early Chinese thought. Although the focus is upon early China, both the subject matter and methodology have wider implications. The subject of wu-wei is relevant to anyone interested in later East Asian religious thought or in the so-called "virtue-ethics" tradition in the West. Moreover, the technique of conceptual metaphor analysis--along with the principle of "embodied realism" upon which it is based--provides an exciting new theoretical framework and methodological tool for the study of comparative thought, comparative religion, intellectual history, and even the humanities in general. Part of the purpose of this work is thus to help introduce scholars in the humanities and social sciences to this methodology, and provide an example of how it may be applied to a particular sub-field.<br></p><p><br><strong>Edward Slingerland</strong> is Assistant Professor of East Asian Languages &amp; Cultures and Religion at the University of Southern California (homepage: www-rcf.usc.edu/~slingerl).<br><br>"This provocative work is the most ambitious general study of pre-Qin thought to appear in more than a decade. ...a rich, stimulating work, full of interpretive insights that shed light on conceptions of ethical perfection in early Chinese thought."--<em>Philosophy East and West</em><p></p><br>"The scope of Slingerland's discussion and his mastery of the relevant scholarship make the book a useful and learned introduction to early Chinese thought."--<em>Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies</em><p></p><br>"Edward Slingerland is one of a group of exciting and creative young scholars revolutionizing the study of Chinese history, culture, and religion by applying the recently developed tools of cognitive analysis, especially conceptual metaphor analysis. <em>Effortless Action</em> is a remarkable work that explores the meaning of the crucial concept of wu-wei in a depth never before achievable, showing how Chinese metaphorical thought forms a nexus around this most central of ideas. If you care about China, about its culture, history, and religion, you will find this book extremely enlightening. And if you are a humanist seeking a deeper understanding of culture and history, this book will open up new worlds to you."--George Lakoff, Professor of Linguistics, <em>University of California, Berkeley</em><p></p><br>"Slingerland shows that wu-wei is a much richer and more pervasive notion than anyone has ever imagined. His work will convince even the most entrenched skeptic that it is an important and often neglected concern of just about every major religious thinker in traditional China."--Philip Ivanhoe, author of <em>Confucian Moral Self Cultivation</em> and <em>Ethics in the Confucian Tradition</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Clanbook Ravnos (Vampire: The Masquerade)</h2><p>RPG Book Paperback: 72 pages Publisher: White Wolf Publishing; First Edition edition (December 1, 1996) Language: English ISBN-10: 1565042174 ISBN-13: 978-1565042179 Product Dimensions: 10.7 x 8.1 x 0.3 inches</p><p></p><h2>Scorsese by Ebert</h2><p><p>Roger Ebert wrote the first film review that director Martin Scorsese ever received&#x2014;for 1967&#x2019;s <i>I Call First</i>, later renamed <i>Who&#x2019;s That Knocking at My Door</i>&#x2014;creating a lasting bond that made him one of Scorsese&#x2019;s most appreciative and perceptive commentators. <i>Scorsese by Ebert</i> offers the first record of America&#x2019;s most respected film critic&#x2019;s engagement with the works of America&#x2019;s greatest living director, chronicling every single feature film in Scorsese&#x2019;s considerable oeuvre, from his aforementioned debut to his 2008 release, the Rolling Stones documentary <i>Shine a Light.</i></p><p>In the course of eleven interviews done over almost forty years, the book also includes Scorsese&#x2019;s own insights on both his accomplishments and disappointments. Ebert has also written and included six new reconsiderations of the director&#x2019;s less commented upon films, as well as a substantial introduction that provides a framework for understanding both Scorsese and his profound impact on American cinema.</p><p>"Given their career-long back-and-forth, this collection makes perfect sense. . . .

In 1975, he teamed up with Gene Siskel of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> to host the popular Sneak Previews movie review program on PBS, which he continued under various titles for more than thirty-five years. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert</i>, the Great Movies collections, and a memoir, <i>Life Itself</i>. His reviews can also be found at RogerEbert.com, the website he cofounded with his wife and partner Chaz Ebert in 2002.<br> &nbsp;<p>"This book is proof that the greatest criticism is simply careful and educated observation that connects a filmmaker with his subject, his audience, and his time. Ebert is one of the most acclaimed and perceptive critics of his time, and this unique book is an invaluable study in the canon of both film and criticism."</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Ebert, film critic for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, is an unabashed fan of Scorsese, whom he considers "the most gifted director of his generation." To prove it, he's compiled his reviews of every Scorsese film-beginning with <i>I Call First</i> in 1967 to his latest, <i>Shine a Light</i>. Along the way, Ebert pays special tribute to five "masterpieces," including <i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>Raging Bull</i> and <i>Mean Streets</i>, which he calls "one of the source points of modern movies." These three films in particular, Ebert argues, reflect Scorsese's ongoing preoccupation with sex and guilt, themes fueled by a Catholic upbringing and his childhood in New York City's Little Italy. Citing the director's strong collaboration with actor Robert De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader, Ebert says all three men seem "fascinated by the lives of tortured, violent, guilt-ridden characters," usually men who cannot relate to women, such as Travis Bickle in <i>Taxi Driver</i> or Jake LaMotta in <i>Raging Bull</i>. Of special note are interviews with Scorsese over a 25-year period, in which the director candidly discusses his body of work." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A film-by-film chronicling of the professional, yet passionate, Ebert-Scorsese relationship. Packaged together are every Ebert review of a Scorsese title, as well as an array of essays, interviews, and the transcript of an on-stage discussion between the director and writer. . . . Ebert has also gone back to write an additional 'reconsideration' of a half-dozen select Scorsese titles. . . . A work of obvious affection, even adoration, what might surprise readers most is how <i>Scorsese by Ebert</i> emerges as a work of profound identification." (S. James Snyder <i>Time</i>)<br><br>"Given their career-long back-and-forth, this collection makes perfect sense. It&#x2019;s a project Ebert has talked about for years, and during his recent recovery from surgery, he finally made it a reality. Ebert has collected all of his original reviews of Scorsese&#x2019;s films, along with interviews and essays on the director. That would be a great thing on its own, but the real strength of this book comes from his new essays about a number of the films. These afford readers a wonderful opportunity to see how someone approaches the same work of art over decades. . . . In these reconsiderations, Ebert invites us into his thought processes, letting us see not just what he thinks, but how he forms his opinions. Ebert&#x2019;s insights into Scorsese are terrific, but this book offers the bonus of further insights into Ebert himself." (<i>Time Out Chicago</i>)<br><br>"[Eberts'] enthusiasm and conviction are obvious here; accordingly, this is some of his best stuff." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Whether you're a Scorsese connoisseur or someone just discovering the acclaimed auteur, Roger Ebert's <i>Scorsese</i> is a thought-provoking appreciation of more than 40 years of masterful moviemaking." (Kyle Rupprecht <i>Movie Maker</i>)<br><br>"<i>Scorsese by Ebert</i> is one of the finest books to ever be written on the medium of film. . . . An illuminating and insightful look at a virtuoso director written by a virtuoso journalist; it's the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of film criticism."

(<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Already a revered film critic, Ebert is also one of the most perceptive writers living today.

Having helped launch directors Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese, and actors Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern and Sylvester Stallone, he is certainly one of the motive forces in American movies today. In this revealing autobiography, written with the coauthor of Papa John , Corman tells amazing tales of shooting full-length films in mere days with budgets under $100,000, and states his conviction that cinema is a fusion of art and money--which explains, he believes, why Americans do it so well. This account of Corman's life and career includes reminiscences by those who have worked with him: performers, directors, assistant producers, writers. The book is a significant contribution to the history of American movies.

In this book, MATLAB is used as a computing tool to explore traditional DSP topics, and solve problems to gain insight. This greatly expands the range and complexity of problems that students can effectively study in the course. Since DSP applications are primarily algorithms implemented on a DSP processor or software, a fair amount of programming is required. Using interactive software such as MATLAB makes it possible to place more emphasis on learning new and difficult concepts than on programming algorithms. Interesting practical examples are discussed and useful problems are explored. This updated second edition includes new homework problems and revises the scripts in the book, available functions, and m-files to MATLAB V7.</p><p>Dr. Vinay K.

Her writing articulates a subtle revolt against, and a sympathetic insight into, the place of women in the essentially male-dominated Islamic environment. </p> <p>Change, development, and understanding are called for but the invocation is couched in specifically Arab terms; her inspiration lies not in the Women's Movement of the West but remains within a strictly religious, even Orthodox Qur'anic framework. </p></p><p>Alifa Rifaat has spent all her life in the Arab world, immersed in the traditions and culture of Islam. She was brought up in Egypt, a devout Muslim, strictly adhering to the Islamic way of life and well versed in the Qu&#39;ran and religious teachings. Her education and a possible future career in art were curtailed when she married - her parents&#39; alternative to university. A widow, she now lives in Cairo with her three children. Largely divorced from Western influences, speaking and writing only Arabic, Alifa Rifaat allows the reader a rare and enlightening glimpse at woman&#39;s condition in a male-dominated environment.Her originality lies not in any overt and conventional feminist approach, but rather through her implicit criticisms of the male neglect of his Islamic obligations to women, particularly in family life and marital relationships. She challenges behaviour from within the accepted framework of her society&#39;s religion and laws. Distant View of a Minaret was first published in English in 1983, by Quartet Books.

The reason for this non-conventional way of expressing ones&#39; name will become clear after reading just a few pages of the book: FREEDOM... Is More Than Just A Seven-Letter Word. The message is exactly what it says; it&#39;s all about freedom. Veronica: Chapman thinks it will surprise you how much you actually do not know about that subject. And how very little, in essence, you really need to know in order to attain it. We hope that, by the time you have read it all the way through, your path into the future will be obvious to you. You should discover that, even at the age of 7 years old, you had more power than any Government, Judiciary, Police Force and Military combined. But you did not realise it. And therefore, throughout your life, you have thrown it away. But take heart, it is still there. And you can learn how to use it. What is worth more than all the gold in the world is your appreciation that, having read this book, you have become empowered in the way you always should have been - had you been educated, rather than indoctrinated - during your childhood. The author is compelled to stretch certain points within the book in order to attempt to overcome the ingrained indoctrination to which we have all been subject throughout our lives.

Not just in the academic world but increasingly in everyday life, we find one set of experts seeking to explain the ends at which humans aim in terms of evolutionary theory, and another set of experts using economic models to give rules of how we act to achieve those ends. Dupr� demonstrates that these theorists' explanations do not work, and furthermore that if taken seriously their theories tend to have dangerous social and political consequences. For these reasons, it is important to resist scientism--an exaggerated conception of what science can be expected to do for us. <br>Dupr� restores sanity to the study of human nature by pointing the way to a proper understanding of humans in the societies that are our natural and necessary environments. Anyone interested in science and human nature will enjoy this book, unless they are its targets.<br></p><p>John Dupre is at University of Exeter.&#34;The interesting question ... is why today&#39;s physicalist-pathology should have achieved a considerable cultural plausibility, and it is here that we find this book&#39;s most innovative and important contribution to the philosophy of science.&#34;</p><h2>HTML: A Beginner&#39;s Guide, Fifth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Essential HTML skills&#x2015;made easy!</b></p><p>Thoroughly updated and revised, <i>HTML: A Beginners Guide, Fifth Edition</i> shows you, step by step, how to create dynamic websites with HTML.

This anthology collects inspiring stories about social justice teaching with young children. Included here is outstanding writing from childcare teachers, early-grade public school teachers, scholars, and parents. Early childhood is when we develop our core dispositions the habits of thinking that shape how we live. This book shows how educators can nurture empathy, an ecological consciousness, curiosity, collaboration, and activism in young children. It invites readers to rethink early childhood education, reminding them that it is inseparable from social justice and ecological education.</p><p>Ann Pelo has been an early childhood educator and teacher mentor for 18 years. She studied Child Development and Family Studies at Purdue University, earning a Masters degree in 1992. From 1992 until 2008 she worked at Hilltop Children&#39;s Center in Seattle as a teacher of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children and as the Mentor Teacher, responsible for professional development at the center. During that time, Pelo was active in the national Worthy Wage Campaign, an effort to improve the wages and working conditions of child care teachers. Pelo has traveled extensively both in the United States and abroad to work with child care and Head Start teachers on emergent, Reggio-inspired teaching practices and on social justice education. She is the co-author, with Fran Davidson, of That&#39;s Not Fair: A Teacher&#39;s Guide to Activism with Young Children, and the author of The Language of Art: Inquiry-Based Studio Practices in Early Childhood Settings. She divides her time between Seattle and Utah, and works on developing practices to connect children to place."The diverse articles give insightful, practical, and moving voice to teachers' experiences with children and families and make diversity, equity, inclusion and preserving the environment integral to a quality early childhood education program." -- Louise Derman-Sparks "faculty emerita, Pacific Oaks College, and author of Anti-Bias Curriculum: Tools for Empowering Young Children"<br><br>"Beautifully weaves together key components for transforming early childhood educators into a leadership force for progressive thinking and teaching. With its range of teacher stories, it provokes critical thinking and imaginative classroom practices.

He proudly proclaims, "I ended up knowing more about script format than anyone else in Hollywood," and on the basis of his new book, this may be a legitimate claim. Designed as a manual for every screenwriter--neophyte or old pro--it presents a format for writing scripts for theatrical feature films, hour-long television drama and long-form television, including made-for-TV movies and series. Riley's presentation will enable screenwriters to absorb material about, say, the necessity for page breaks, paragraphing and capitalization, without feeling intimidated. The book's strength lies in its ability to combine important specifics (e.g., the proper use of punctuation) with broader aspects of scriptwriting (e.g., how to describe what's being seen and heard within a shot or sequence). Toward the book's end, Riley incorporates all his lessons and suggestions into a section on the evolution of a script from first draft to production draft; appendixes offer sample script pages. Riley, who's also written screenplays for Touchstone Pictures, Paramount and Mandalay, supplies what may be the first accurate, complete and practical guide to standard script formats, a reference that writers of film would do well to keep handy as they work. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Asawa began her now iconic looped-wire works in the late 1940s while still a student at Black Mountain College. Their unique structure was inspired by a 1947 trip to Mexico, during which local craftsmen taught her how to create baskets out of wire. While seemingly unrelated to the lessons of color and composition taught in Josef Albers&#x2019;s legendary Basic Design course, these works, as she explained, are firmly grounded in his teachings in their use of unexpected materials and their elision of figure and ground. Presenting an important and timely overview of the artist&#x2019;s work, this monograph brings together a broad selection of her sculptures, works on paper, and more. Together the body of work demonstrates the centrality of Asawa&#x2019;s innovative practice to the art-historical legacy of the twentieth century. In addition to an incredible group of photographs of the artist and her work by Imogen Cunningham, a selection of rare archival materials will illustrate a chronology of the artist&#x2019;s life and work. Featuring an extensive text by Tiffany Bell which explores the artist&#x2019;s influences, history, and, most importantly, the work itself, as well as a significant essay by Robert Storr discussing Asawa&#x2019;s work in relation to mid-twentieth century art history, culture, and scientific theory.</p><p>Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) has exhibited widely throughout the world since the early 1950s. In 1965, Walter Hopps organized a solo exhibition of the artist&#x2019;s sculptures and drawings at the Pasadena Art Museum (now Norton Simon Museum) in California, where the artist completed a residency at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop the same year. Other solo presentations include those held at the San Francisco Museum of Art (1973); Fresno Art Museum, California (traveled to Oakland Museum of California; 2001-2002); de Young Museum, San Francisco (2006); Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth, Texas (2012); and Norton Simon Museum of Art, California (2014).This exquisite book is appropriate to its subject and an excellent introduction to an artist only belatedly becoming known to a larger art world.

M. Forster recognition as a major writer. Soon to be a limited series on Starz.<br><br>At its heart lie two families&#x2014;the wealthy and business-minded Wilcoxes and the cultured and idealistic Schlegels. When the beautiful and independent Helen Schlegel begins an impetuous affair with the ardent Paul Wilcox, a series of events is sparked&#x2014;some very funny, some very tragic&#x2014;that results in a dispute over who will inherit Howards End, the Wilcoxes' charming country home. <br><br>As much about the clash between individual wills as the clash between the sexes and the classes, <i>Howards End</i> is a novel whose central tenet, "Only connect," remains a powerful prescription for modern life.<br><br>Introduction by Alfred Kazan</p><p>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)</p></p><p>Margaret Schlegel, engaged to the much older, widowed Henry Wilcox, meets her intended the morning after accepting his proposal and realizes that he is a man who has lived without introspection or true self-knowledge. As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>France 1814 - 1914 (Longman History of France)</h2><p>Here is an incomparably rich portrait of France in the years when the disparate elements that made up the fragmented kingdom of the ancien regime were forged into the modern nation. The survey begins with an exploration of national obsessions and attitudes. It considers the tendency to revolution and war, the preoccupation with the idea of a New Order and the deep strain of national paranoia that was to be intensified by the dramatic debacle of the Franco-Prussian War. Robert Tombs then investigates the structures of power and in Part Three he turns his attention to social identities, from the individual and family to the nation at large.

It was not exactly the kind of celebrity he had wished for. &#39;Madame Bovary&#39; had appeared serially in &#39;La Revue de Paris&#39;. Now the imperial prosecutor was attacking the work for being offensive to religion and morality. Not only the seduction scenes, but the episodes dealing with religion and the description of Emma&#39;s death, came under direct censure. More than the subject, the general tone of the novel was denounced as immoral: the pervasive eroticism, the poetry of adultery, the so-called &#39;realism&#39; of the style. Flaubert, excellently defended by his lawyer, was acquitted. The book was published soon after, benefiting from the advance courtroom publicity.<b>Chris Kraus</b> is the author of the novels<i> I Love Dick, Aliens &amp; Anorexia,</i> and <i>Torpor,</i> and a collection of essays, <i>Video Green: Los Angeles Art and the Triumph of Nothingness.</i> She is co-editor, with Sylvere Lotringer and Hedi El Kholti, of the independent press Semiotext(e).

But classic New Orleans cooking is neither easily learned nor mastered. More than thirty years ago, beloved Paul Prudhomme taught the ways of Crescent City cooking but, even in tradition-steeped New Orleans, classic recipes have evolved and fans of what is arguably the most popular regional cuisine in America are ready for an updated approach. With step-by-step photos and straightforward instructions, James Beard Award-winner Justin Devillier details the fundamentals of the New Orleans cooking canon--from proper roux-making to time-honored recipes, such as Duck and Andouille Gumbo and the more casual Abita Root Beer-Braised Short Ribs. Locals, Southerners, and food tourists alike will relish Devillier's modern-day approach to classic New Orleans cooking.</p><p>JUSTIN DEVILLIER, son of a fourth-generation Louisianan, is an avid angler and hunter, and the chef-owner of three nationally lauded restaurants in New Orleans--La Petite Grocery in the Garden District and Justine in the French Quarter. He was a contestant on <i>Top Chef: New Orleans</i> in 2013, has written for <i>Saveur</i>, was named Chef of the Year by <i>New Orleans</i> magazine in 2014, and won the James Beard Foundation's award for Best Chef: South in 2016 after being named a finalist in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. JAMIE FELDMAR is the coauthor of Naomi Pomeroy's <i>Taste &amp; Technique</i> and a contributing writer to the<i> New York Times</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, among other publications.Introduction<br><br> New Orleans is in my blood, but my story starts two thousand miles away from here, in Dana Point, California. That&#x2019;s where I grew up, the son of a fourth-generation Louisiana father and a Philadelphia-bred Irish Polish mother. My mom was a healthcare professional, but she also had a catering company on the side, and she was a total kitchen workhorse, plowing through prep for five hundred stuffed mushrooms like it was no big deal. She let me play around in the kitchen from the time I was very young, teaching me how to fry eggs and make grilled cheese before I even went to elementary school.<br><br> My dad was an electrical engineer for the Department of Defense and, to be honest, he wasn&#x2019;t much of a cook. My parents split up when I was young, and I spent weekends at his house, where he had a few old Paul Prudhomme cookbooks&#x2014;not because he wanted to master the art of Cajun cooking, but because he missed the food of his childhood and wanted to re-create some of those dishes in Southern California. I spent a lot of time flipping through those books, which were filled with crazy-long ingredient lists and super-specific instructions on how to do things like darken roux and brown meat.<br><br> I loved how detailed Prudhomme&#x2019;s recipes were, and as I got a little older, I started applying some of his techniques to my own culinary experiments. My mom&#x2019;s house was two minutes from the ocean, and I was the quintessential beach rat as a kid, surfing and fishing nonstop with a motley crew of other teens. We&#x2019;d haul our fishing bounty back to shore to cook over a bonfire on the beach. At first it was really basic, but soon I started paying closer attention to recipes, following instructions to a T and learning more about how flavors and techniques interacted. As I cooked more and grew more confident, I started playing around a little, improvising with sauces and cooking techniques to prepare our catch.<br><br> All through high school I worked in restaurants, washing dishes and making pizzas, and loving every second of it. When I graduated, I moved a few hours north and enrolled in culinary school. I also got a job cooking at Disneyland&#x2014;not in the park itself, but on the tourist-heavy promenade, which had themed restaurants as far as the eye could see. I landed at Ralph Brennan&#x2019;s Jazz Kitchen, a New Orleans&#x2013;style restaurant, which I specifically sought out because of my dad&#x2019;s influence. We&#x2019;d gone to New Orleans to visit his side of the family when I was kid, and I&#x2019;d always loved the Creole and Cajun food, rich in French and Spanish traditions, but mixed with West African and Southern influences. I was intrigued by this fluid cuisine, which seemed rooted in classic techniques but also open to&#x2014;if not reliant on&#x2014;improvisation.<br><br> The Jazz Kitchen was a great education because it did fifteen hundred covers a day. I ripped through the line every night, cranked to eleven at all times, loving every second of the intensity. Once, one of my coworkers asked me, &#x201c;Why are you going to culinary school? You&#x2019;ll learn more here than you&#x2019;ll ever learn there,&#x201d; and I knew he was right&#x2014;my cooking school classmates were largely amateurs pursuing cooking as a hobby. So I dropped out of culinary school and got a kitchen job working the overnight shift at a hotel near my mom&#x2019;s house.<br><br> At this point, all I thought about and read about was food&#x2014;I tore through cookbooks and food magazines, and watched a lot of <i>Great Chefs </i>on PBS; loving the lo-fi production&#x2014;just a cook preparing three dishes with clear instructions and no showmanship. I was obsessed with learning classic techniques, and I&#x2019;d practice making the same dishes dozens of times until I mastered them. I had a copy of<i> The Food Lover&#x2019;s Companion </i>and knew it cover to cover&#x2014;I wanted to be able to look through cookbooks and know what everything was.<br><br> It was important for me to learn this stuff because I wanted to make a career out of cooking, and I had big professional ambitions. But I learned a lot about home cooking during this period, too. By following all these recipes word for word, I started to understand how and why flavors and techniques work, and how they come together to create a great dish. Once that groundwork was laid, I was able to start improvising a bit, while still adhering to the essential methods I&#x2019;d mastered. In a way, it was like New Orleans cuisine itself, which relies on just a few fundamental techniques and ingredients but thrives on the creativity of its chefs.<br><br> That&#x2019;s when it all started to click for me, and that&#x2019;s what I want to do for you now. Instead of showing you how to re-create dishes like the&nbsp; ones you&#x2019;ve had in my restaurants, I want to teach you the fundamentals&nbsp;behind these classic recipes. I want you to begin to understand how an ingredient might affect flavor, or why one technique in New Orleans cooking is called for over another. Once you start to understand cooking as something beyond the rote following of instructions, you will become more confident in your ability, and that&#x2019;s when things really start to get fun.<br><br> Cooking is about a combination of thoughtfulness and intuition. Once you have the techniques in place, you can start to go off script. It&#x2019;s okay to play around a little&#x2014;and in fact, it&#x2019;s encouraged&#x2014;once you start to understand how things work. In some ways, the purpose of this book is twofold: first, to get you to understand more, and then, to let go and simply enjoy applying what you know.<br><br> It took me a long time to learn these lessons. First, I had to spread my wings and get out of California. I chose New Orleans for many reasons&#x2014;the family connection, the cost of living, and because I&#x2019;d read an article about a local chef named Anne Kearney, whose restaurant, Peristyle, served exactly the kind of food I wanted to make&#x2014;very Creole but very French, with lots of demi-glace and butter sauces and seasonal produce. Her food felt so perfectly New Orleans to me&#x2014;rooted in tradition, but constantly evolving, depending on what was fresh and available. I wanted in.<br><br> I arrived in New Orleans in 2003, at the tender age of twenty-two. I emailed my old friends at Ralph Brennan&#x2019;s Jazz Kitchen, and they set me up with a line cook job at their fine-dining Italian restaurant in town. But one day, I went to Peristyle to meet Anne and tell her I wanted to work for her. I remember her opening the door, me introducing myself, and her immediately giving me a written test, right then and there, with questions about how to cook a piece of fish and the names of three mother sauces. Finally! Payoff for all my obsessive reading and practicing.<br><br> It took a few months, but eventually, a line cook position opened at Peristyle and I started working there full-time.<br> I was in heaven&#x2014;I had read about the kinds of techniques and flavors Anne used, but it wasn&#x2019;t until I worked with her that I finally got to dive deep into that style of cooking. I&#x2019;d found my place. Working there exposed me to tons of ingredients for the first time&#x2014;foie gras, sweetbreads, wild mushrooms, and baby fennel&#x2014;and techniques I use to this day, like how to make mayonnaise and clean an artichoke.<br><br> I would have stayed at Peristyle forever, but Anne eventually decided to sell to a new owner, and it was time for me to move on. I was on the market when one of my Peristyle colleagues called and offered me a job&nbsp; at his new restaurant, La Petite Grocery. I took him up on it, and the gig was great. At the time, it was the hottest new restaurant in town, with a kind of French bistro&#x2013;meets&#x2013;Louisiana kitchen vibe. I worked there for about a year before leaving in early 2005 with the goal of becoming a sous-chef at one of the high-end new restaurants in the city. Things were going according to plan for a few months, until Hurricane Katrina hit, and everything changed.<br><br> It&#x2019;s painful for me to dwell on that period&#x2014;it was a dark chapter, with a lot of heartbreak and loss. My house was flooded and my personal possessions destroyed, and the restaurant I was working at was totally out of commission. When the storm happened, I&#x2019;d been dating my now-wife and business partner, Mia, for a few months. We evacuated and spent two weeks driving across the South, eventually winding up in Charleston, South Carolina, where Mia is from. The one upside from the storm was that it gave me a chance to get out of the kitchen and experience dining from the other side, as a customer, at some of the best restaurants in the South. That was eye-opening for me, to eat out and really start to understand what chefs were trying to say with their food. It all comes back to that idea of mastering fundamental techniques and flavors and then getting creative with them. I could finally see it in action, from outside the kitchen.</p><h2>The Canterbury Tales (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p>Geoffrey Chaucer The Everyman Paperback Classics series offers the latest scholarship on the works of the world&#39;s greatest poets, writers and philosophers.

Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of the Franklin, the Pardoner, or the Squire because you never learned Middle English, take heart: this edition of the <i>Tales</i> has been translated into modern idiom. <p> From the heroic romance of "The Knight's Tale" to the low farce embodied in the stories of the Miller, the Reeve, and the Merchant, Chaucer treated such universal subjects as love, sex, and death in poetry that is simultaneously witty, insightful, and poignant. <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a grand tour of 14th-century English mores and morals--one that modern-day readers will enjoy.</p>This textbook series provides concise and lucid introductions to major works of literature, from classical antiquity to the twentieth century. Each book provides close reading of the text, as well as giving a full account of its historical, cultural and intellectual background, a discussion of its influence, and further reading.</p><h2>Sleepy Hollow: A Novelization (Includes the Classic Short Story)</h2><p>HEADS WILL ROLL It is 1799, the eve if a new century. In New York City, young Constable Ichabod Crane is eager to use his latest scientific methods and his powers of deduction to solve the most brutal of crimes. But nothing can prepare him for the shocking murders that take him far from the city&#39;s cobblestones to the eerie town of Sleepy Hollow. Awaiting him are three beheaded bodies, all apparently victims of a legendary Headless Horseman returned from the grave to exact revenge. With the help of an orphaned child and a beautiful young woman, Ichabod uses reason to confront the horrors of the unexplained. But the reality of Sleepy Hollow&#39;s waking nightmare is always before him. A reality where witches cast spells in the darkened woods...trees bleed...and a demon rides at night.</p><p>It's 1799, and a charming bumbler of a constable has been sent from New York City to the quiet little village of Sleepy Hollow where three beheaded bodies await him. Hoping to match deductive reasoning against the superstitions of the villagers, Ichabod Crane sets out to determine the motive of the killer at large. Unfortunately, the killer does not seem to be of the living, breathing variety; the specter of the Headless Horseman has been haunting the hamlet for over 20 years. With the help of the exquisite daughter of his host, Ichabod delves dangerously deep into the mystery.<p> Based on Washington Irving's classic <i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>, this bone-chilling story takes the premise, setting, and characters from the original to create a fresh, spooky tale. Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's movie adaptation) is a more appealing character than Irving's constable; here his clumsiness endears, while the original Ichabod is a figure for mockery. Readers may be surprised at the understated hilarity of Irving's original story, included in its entirety following the adaptation. Don't be content with the film version alone--this story is well worth a read in the gloaming of the day. Includes eight pages of full-color photos from the film. <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><b>Peter Lerangis</b> is the author of over 140 books for early readers through teens, including <i>The Sword Thief, </i>the third book of the <i>New York </i>Times bestselling series, The 39 Clues.

Considering a variety of theoretical approaches including those of Ingarden, Eco, Dolezel, Pavel, and Hrushovski, McHale shows that the common denominator is postmodernist fiction's ability to thrust its own ontological status into the foreground and to raise questions about the world (or worlds) in which we live.

This classic text describes the philosophy and use of Aleister Crowley's <i>Thoth Tarot</i>, a deck designed by Crowley and painted by Lady Frieda Harris. <i>The Thoth Tarot</i> has become one of the bestselling tarot decks in the world. It is also one of the most original interpretations of the tarot, incorporating astrological, numerological, Egyptian, and Qabalistic symbolism. While there are many other useful guides to this famous tarot deck, there are no others that explain the deck in its designer's own words.</p><p>This new facsimile edition of <i>The Book of Thoth</i> is a faithful reproduction of the Samuel Weiser Inc. 1969 edition, which in turn was a facsimile of the original O.T.O. edition printed in 1944. The text is digitally restored, printed on a heavy, coated stock, and features revised color plates and black and white illustrations of the <i>Thoth Tarot</i> based on new photography of the original art, courtesy of the O.T.O. and The Warburg Institute. The book text block is smyth sewn, with a rounded back, and headbands. Printed endpaper reproduces the Egyptian motif from the board covers of the 1944 edition. The cover is quality cloth over boards with gold stamping on the spine, and is wrapped with a jacket which again features updated art while matching the original design. Weiser Books takes pride in the release of this new hardcover reprint on the event of our 60th anniversary in publishing.</p><p>"<i>The Book of Thoth</i> is an indispensable companion to the deck and the most authoritative and reliable guide to the Tarot in the New Aeon." --Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, O.T.O.</p><p>Replaces ISBN 9780877282686</p></p><p>Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was the most widely read author in 20th-century occultism. He single-handedly redefined magic as a field of inquiry and endeavor through his books and the order that he led--the A.A. and the O.T.O. He is the author several books including The Book of the Law, 777 &amp; Other Qabalistic Writings, and The Book of Thoth."If any book in the world deserves to be enshrined in hardcover immortality it is Aleister Crowley's magnum opus and magical time-capsule, <i>The Book of Thoth</i>. The Weiser facsimile edition is breathtakingly magnificent." --<b>Lon Milo DuQuette</b>, author of <i>Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot</i> (<i>Reviews</i>)<br><br>"This edition of <i>The Book of Thoth</i>, Crowley's masterpiece on the Tarot, is as well-constructed and weighty as its subject matter, with full-color images as vivid as the original. It is an exceptional edition of a controversial and critical work in the history of modern Tarot that eloquently unravels the depths of this esoteric subject." --<b>Colin Campbell</b>, author of <i>Of the Arte Goetia, The Magic Seal of Dr. John Dee</i>, and <i>A Concordance to the Holy Books of Thelema</i> (<i>Reviews</i>)<br><br><p>"Aleister Crowley published his masterpiece on the Tarot, <i>The Book of Thoth</i>, in 1944. It was produced in an exquisitely printed, limited, numbered, and signed edition of 200 copies that has been a treasured collector's edition since. Its eight color plates of several cards were hand-pasted in.</p><p>In 1969, Samuel Weiser, Inc. published a well-executed second edition reprint of the 1944 book. A quality hardcover with a lovely book jacket and full-color illustrations as per Crowley's choices, it was reprinted several times until replaced by the ubiquitous trade paperback in the early 1970s, in print ever since.</p><p>This year, in celebration of the 60th Anniversary of Weiser Books has done it again. They have reissued a brand new high quality hardcover that is a true third edition. First, they worked with O.T.O. on replacing the original artwork (color and black-and-white) with color-corrected photos and scans of the original paintings in the Warburg Institute painted by Frieda Lady Harris. They also reproduced the beloved 1969 jacket, with more generous inside flaps and better paper. As a real treat, the book includes high quality color endpapers of the Egyptian design that was printed on the cover of Crowley's 1944 edition. The text paper used in the book is a quality coated art paper which highlights the color plates as well as the halftones of the entire deck.</p><p>No words are needed to describe the importance of this book in Crowley's literary corpus.

Both structurally and psychologically compact, it is among the most expressive of the Russian playwright's dramatic works.<br>Set on an estate in nineteenth-century Russia, this deeply emotional tale of misplaced idealism and unrequited love concerns the complex interrelationships between a retired professor, his second wife, and his brother-in-law and daughter from a previous marriage. In deceptively mundane dialogue, the characters reveal their private tragedies &#x2014; weakness and inability to communicate &#x2014; the failures that lead them to lives of frustration and despair. Nevertheless, Chekhov's delineation of human frailties elicits sympathy for even the most irresolute and deluded characters, and the play's underlying message is one of courage and hope.<br>Essential reading for any course in modern theater, this absorbing play continues to be popular. Students, theatergoers, and all lovers of great drama will appreciate this inexpensive edition of a masterpiece.</p><p></p></p><p>In Uncle Vanya, a retired professor and his beautiful young wife return to the country estate left by his deceased first wife to find themselves overwhelmed by the stagnant inevitability of the rituals of their life and class and mercilessly taxed by the encroachment of age at the expense of youth. All of the play&#39;s characters are plunged into that precarious state where, in Beckett&#39;s words, &#39;the boredom of living is replaced by the suffering of being.&#39;Next to Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) is the most popular playwright in the English-speaking world.

She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages.

As a consequence, there is a wide demand for a survey of the results of mathematics, for an unconventional approach that would also make it possible to fill gaps in one&#39;s knowledge. We do not think that a mere juxtaposition of theorems or a collection of formulae would be suitable for this purpose, because this would over� emphasize the symbolic language of signs and letters rather than the mathematical idea, the only thing that really matters. Our task was to describe mathematical interrelations as briefly and precisely as possible. In view of the overwhelming amount of material it goes without saying that we did not just compile details from the numerous text-books for individual branches: what we were aiming at is to smooth out the access to the specialist literature for as many readers as possible. Since well over 700000 copies of the German edition of this book have been sold, we hope to have achieved our difficult goal. Colours are used extensively to help the reader. Important definitions and groups of formulae are on a yellow background, examples on blue, and theorems on red.</p><p>Text: English, German</p><h2>Attachment Theory and Close Relationships</h2><p>In the last decade, few topics in social and personality psychology have attracted more interest than the application of attachment theory to adult relationships.

It is intended for all who seek a solid, detailed, and challenging foundation for their ministries in the &#34;Blessed Sacrament&#34; of Baptism as the Third Christian Millennium dawns.</p><p>In The Rites of Christian Initiation Maxwell Johnson surveys the development and theology of these rites from their New Testament origins to their current forms in the Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Lutheran Churches. Together with abundant selections of primary texts in English translation, The Rites of Christian Initiation offers a critique of traditional scholarship, suggests new ways of looking at some of the classic sources, provides a critical assessment of selected contemporary rites, and calls for a recovery of an ecumenical-baptismal spirituality to guide the Churches as the third Christian millennium dawns. Written from the perspective of liturgical texts, history, theology, and pastoral implications of Christian initiation, The Rites of Christian Initiation provides in one volume an overall and detailed introduction to the initiation rites. As a companion volume to Living Water, Sealing Spirit, it takes account of the contemporary advances in scholarship on early Christian liturgical sources pioneered in Paul F. Bradshaw?s study The Search for the Origins of Christian Worship and the reconstructive insights of Thomas Talley on the early evolution of the liturgical year in his revolutionary Origins of the Liturgical Year. Chapter one begins with the New Testament origins of the rites. The next three chapters deal with the further evolution of those rites and related issues within the early Churches of the first few centuries: the pre-Nicene period, the first major period of liturgical change during the fourth and fifth centuries, and renewal in the fourth and fifth centuries in the East and West. Chapter five deals with baptismal preparation and the origins of Lent. Chapter six surveys what has been called for the West the disintegration of the rites of Christian initiation within the medieval period. Chapter seven addresses the change brought about by the Protestant and Catholic Reformations of the sixteenth century. Chapter eight surveys the development, current form, theological interpretations, and contemporary probes surrounding the initiation rites in some of the Churches of today; and chapter nine suggests several implications of a baptismal spirituality for the Churches today. While written especially with seminarians and students of liturgy and theology in mind, The Rites of Christian Initiation is intended for all?pastors, catechists, RCIA directors, and others?who seek a solid, engaging formation for their ministries today in the ?Blessed Sacrament? of baptism. Chapters are ?The Origins of Christian Initiation? ?Christian Initiation in the Pre-Nicene Period,? ?Initiation in the Christian East During the Fourth and Fifth Centuries,? ?Initiation in the Christian West During the Fourth and Fifth Centuries,? ?Baptismal Preparation and the Origins of Lent? ?Christian Initiation in the Middle Ages,? ?Christian Initiation in the Protestant and Catholic Reforms of the Sixteenth Century,? ?Christian Initiation in the Churches Today,? and ?Back Home to the Font: The Place of Baptismal Spirituality in a Displaced World.??Maxwell Johnson has done an excellent job of taking the bowl of theological-historical-liturgical spaghetti and making it digestible.?

But Haynes creates a wholly distinctive new style by drawing on her own Southern roots and the "noble country" language of her youth in this remarkable first novel. <p>Set in a small Mississippi town in the late 1950s, MOTHER OF PEARL is populated by wonderfully rich and original characters with themes of identity and the true meaning of family interwoven throughout. The story revolves around twenty-eight-year-old Even Grade, a black man who grew up an orphan, and Valuable Korner, a fifteen-year-old white girl whose is the daughter of the town whore and an unknown father. Their paths cross through Joody Two Sun, a seer, who sets up camp along the riverbank just outside of town and becomes Even's lover. Both Even and Valuable are seeking the family, love and commitment they never had, and their search ultimately takes both of them to places they never dreamed they'd go. </p><p>Told in beautifully naunced narrative with a staggering richness that resonates with emotional truth, MOTHER OF PEARL is a haunting, bittersweet tale of the search for identity and the power of renewal.</p></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, June 1999:</b> Twenty-eight-year-old Even Grade is a black man who was orphaned as a child; 15-year-old Valuable Korner is a white girl who might as well have been. Petal, Mississippi, circa 1956, seems an unlikely spot for these two to connect, but it soon becomes apparent in <i>Mother of Pearl</i> that a friendship across race lines is just one of many miracles waiting to happen in this small Southern town. Melinda Haynes's remarkable debut novel begins in a hot August, when young Val's lifelong friendship with Jackson McClain is starting to change into something more profound, and Even is falling crazy in love with Joody Two Sun, a mixed-race woman with amazing powers.<p> Woven in and around these two central love stories are myriad other characters, other tales. There is 16-year-old Joleb Green, for example, whose mother was incapacitated by a stroke when he was born, and who was raised by the black housekeeper, Grace. There is Even's friend Canaan, an older black man who spends his time reading Greek tragedy and writing his work "The Reality of the Negro"; Valuable's mother, Enid, the town whore; and Neva and Bea, a lesbian couple who have helped to raise the girl. Until this year, blacks and whites have occupied separate universes, for the most part; then Joleb Green suffers a terrible accident, and it is Joody Two Sun who saves his life and Grace who restores his soul. At the same time, a pregnant Val arrives on Joody and Even's doorstep, hungry for the understanding and acceptance she cannot find at home. Though at first Even is resistant, Val's humanity soon transcends her color in his mind: </p><blockquote>Even chuckled and shook his head, happy for a reason he couldn't distinguish other than at that moment of Canaan's near-perfect cast, all seemed right with the world, as right as a thing can be what with a white girl camped out in the middle of the Quarter with no plans of leaving.</blockquote> Gradually, without really intending it, Joleb, Val, Even, Joody, Grace, and Canaan form something that looks suspiciously like a family--a relationship that will soon be tested to the limit when Val's baby is born.<p> Melinda Haynes has taken on a Herculean task, crafting a multicharacter story that reaches across racial barriers to encompass an entire community. She doesn't shy away from the ugliness in life--bigotry of every stripe, mean-spiritedness, betrayal, thoughtless cruelty, and death--but what interests her is the potential of the human heart to find space within itself for the most unexpected people. With its strong, lyrical language and fully realized characters, <i>Mother of Pearl</i> is a fine novel and a terrific introduction to a new literary voice. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Melinda Haynes grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

Funk shows us that the best way to understand the catastrophe of global warming is to see it through the eyes of those who see it most clearly&#x2014;as a market opportunity.<br><br>Global warming&#x2019;s physical impacts can be separated into three broad categories: melt, drought, and deluge. Funk travels to two dozen countries to profile entrepreneurial people who see in each of these forces a potential windfall.<br><br>The melt is a boon for newly arable, mineral-rich regions of the Arctic, such as Greenland&#x2014;and for the surprising kings of the manmade snow trade, the Israelis. The process of desalination, vital to Israel&#x2019;s survival, can produce a snowlike by-product that alpine countries use to prolong their ski season.<p><br>Drought creates opportunities for private firefighters working for insurance companies in California as well as for fund managers backing south Sudanese warlords who control local farmland. As droughts raise food prices globally, there is no more precious asset.</p><p><br>The deluge&#x2014;the rising seas, surging rivers, and superstorms that will threaten island nations and coastal cities&#x2014;has been our most distant concern, but after Hurricane Sandy and failure after failure to cut global carbon emissions, it is not so distant. For Dutch architects designing floating cities and American scientists patenting hurricane defenses, the race is on. For low-lying countries like Bangladesh, the coming deluge presents an existential threat.</p><p><br>Funk visits the front lines of the melt, the drought, and the deluge to make a human accounting of the booming business of global warming. By letting climate change continue unchecked, we are choosing to adapt to a warming world. Containing the resulting surge will be big business; some will benefit, but much of the planet will suffer. McKenzie Funk has investigated both sides, and what he has found will shock us all.&nbsp;</p><p><br>To understand how the world is preparing to warm,&nbsp;<i>Windfall</i>&nbsp;follows the money.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2014</strong>: In addition to having one of the cooler author names, Funk has written one of the more fascinating accounts of the coming economic impact of climate change. Rather than exploring the science or politics of an alarmingly warming world (a la <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>), the author has focused exclusively on the economics and opportunism developing around climate change. The result is part eco-thriller, part adventure story, part investigative expos�. There&#x2019;s a wildly speculative and entrepreneurial game being played out there by some forward-thinking risk takers. Not a hand-wringer among them, these are the gamblers who see profit where others see doom. Impressively researched over six years, <em>Windfall</em> takes us to the front lines: to the deck of a Canadian battleship, where the author blasts a machine gun into the ice cap; to formerly frozen Siberian lands, which investors envision as future mega-farms; to the Sudan, Greenland, Wall Street, and beyond. Like a mashup of Michael Lewis and Mark Twain, Funk is an intrepid investigator and a lively, smart writer. From eco hedge funds to dam building to desalination plants, he shows how climate change is creating new opportunities and a potential boon for cowboy entrepreneurs. This is the rare book that&#x2019;s both important and highly readable. --<em>Neal Thompson</em>McKenzie Funk is a journalist whose work has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Harper's</i>,&nbsp;<i>National Geographic</i>,&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone</i>,&nbsp;<i>Outside</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.

A deliciously witty satire of popular Gothic romances, it is perhaps Austen&#x2019;s lightest, most delightful excursion into a young woman&#x2019;s world. Catherine Morland, an unlikely heroine&#x2014;unlikely because she is so ordinary&#x2014;forsakes her English village for the pleasures and perils of Bath. There, among a circle of Austen&#x2019;s wonderfully vain, dissembling, and fashionable characters, she meets a potential suitor, Henry Tilney. But with her imagination fueled by melodramatic novels, Catherine turns a visit to his home, Northanger Abbey, into a hunt for dark family secrets. The result is a series of hilarious social gaffes and harsh awakenings that for all of Austen&#x2019;s youthful exuberance nevertheless conveys her mature vision of literature and life&#x2014;and the consequences of mistaking one for the other.</p><p>Though <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is one of Jane Austen's earliest novels, it was not published until after her death--well after she'd established her reputation with works such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Emma</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Of all her novels, this one is the most explicitly literary in that it is primarily concerned with books and with readers. In it, Austen skewers the novelistic excesses of her day made popular in such 18th-century Gothic potboilers as Ann Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>. Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers all figure into <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, but with a decidedly satirical twist. Consider Austen's introduction of her heroine: we are told on the very first page that "no one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine." The author goes on to explain that Miss Morland's father is a clergyman with "a considerable independence, besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters." Furthermore, her mother does <i>not</i> die giving birth to her, and Catherine herself, far from engaging in "the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush" vastly prefers playing cricket with her brothers to any girlish pastimes. <p> Catherine grows up to be a passably pretty girl and is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with a family friend. While there she meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who invite her to visit their family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Austen amuses herself and us as Catherine, a great reader of Gothic romances, allows her imagination to run wild, finding dreadful portents in the most wonderfully prosaic events. But Austen is after something more than mere parody; she uses her rapier wit to mock not only the essential silliness of "horrid" novels, but to expose the even more horrid workings of polite society, for nothing Catherine imagines could possibly rival the hypocrisy she experiences at the hands of her supposed friends. In many respects <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the most lighthearted of Jane Austen's novels, yet at its core is a serious, unsentimental commentary on love and marriage, 19th-century British style. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>One of the first of Jane Austen&#39;s novels to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid Gothic novels that were popular during Austen&#39;s youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen&#39;s famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes, and an appendix summarising the plots and situations of the Gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen&#39;s comedy. In addition there is an extensive critical introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and authoritative textual apparatus.</p><h2>The Mask of Benevolence: Disabling the Deaf Community</h2><p>A look at the gulf that separates the deaf minority from the hearing world, this book sheds light on the mistreatment of the deaf community by a hearing establishment that resists understanding and awareness. Critically acclaimed as a breakthrough when it was first published in 1992, this new edition includes information on the science and ethics of childhood cochlear implants. An indictment of the ways in which experts in the scientific, medical, and educational establishment purport to serve the deaf,&nbsp;this book&nbsp;describes how they, in fact, do them great harm.</p><p><b>Harlan Lane</b> is recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship and of the World Federation of the Deaf International Social Merit Award. He is the author of <i>When the Mind Hears: A History of the Deaf, The Wild Boy of Aveyron</i>, and <i>Journey into the Deaf World</i>. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts.Lane (Psychology/Northeastern) follows up When the Mind Hears- -his 1984 history of the deaf--with an excoriating analysis of the oppression of the deaf in contemporary society. Hearing people, Lane says, view deafness as a disability--but the deaf see themselves as a linguistic minority, feel that they have a richer social life than hearing people, marry each other, and celebrate the birth of a deaf child as a precious gift. After developing these preconception-shattering revelations, Lane reveals the meshes of paternalistic control exercised by ``audism''--that institution of school administrators, speech therapists, psychologists, and social workers that authorizes views of the deaf, governs where they go to school, and exercises authority over their community. Despite research showing that American Sign Language is a natural language with its own vocabulary, grammar, and art forms, professionals persist in viewing it as disabled English and refuse to learn it. The consequences for the deaf are dire: IQ scores can be lowered 30 points by examiners resorting to ad hoc pantomime for test instruction; psychologists administer tests designed for the hearing and misdiagnose deaf children as learning-disabled; deaf youth are ``mainstreamed'' out of special schools to languish in a hearing, English-speaking environment. The audist establishment, Lane says, has promulgated calling deaf children ``hearing-impaired''--the equivalent, he adds, of calling women ``non-men'' or gays ``sexually impaired.'' And economic self- interest motivates the audist establishment, Lane argues. The hearing-aid industry, for example, annually sells $250 million dollars' worth of hearing aids to deaf children, whose teachers require them. Yet virtually all of these children went deaf before learning English, making the hearing aids useless. What is to be done to empower the deaf? Allow them their language, Lane says, and their history and their dignity. Essential for anyone with a deaf person in his or her life, or for anyone who wishes truly to understand two million deaf fellow Americans. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Exploring how spirituality influenced artists in the late 20th century and bringing together an intergenerational group of artists from North, Central, and South America, <i>NeoHooDoo</i> reveals the wider implications of ritualized practice in contemporary art.</p><p>This book examines the work of thirty-three artists&#x2013;&#x2013;including Jimmie Durham, David Hammons, Jos� Bedia, Rebecca Belmore, and James Lee Byars&#x2013;&#x2013;who began using ritualistic practices during the 1970s and 1980s as a way of reinterpreting aspects of their cultural heritage. Younger artists such as Tania Bruguera and Michael Joo are shown to have drawn upon the iconography of ritual. The original essays, which range over artistic use of ritual as a form of therapy, catharsis, or political critique, stand alongside contributions from NeoHooDoo&#x2019;s key sources of inspiration: Robert Farris Thompson, Ishmael Reed, and Quincy Troupe.</p></p><p><p>Franklin Sirmans is curator of modern and contemporary art at The Menil Collection.

Paul Getty Museum</h2><p>Eug�ne Atget (1857-1927) spent nearly thirty years photographing details of often-inconspicuous buildings, side streets, cul-de-sacs, and public sculptures in his beloved Paris. Yet before his death, he was practically unknown outside of that city. His genius was first recognized about 1924 by two young Americans living and working in Paris, Man Ray and his studio assistant, Berenice Abbott, who recognized the elements of contradiction, ambivalence, and ambiguity in Atget's images of Parisian architecture, streets, and parks.<br><br> Presented in this volume are more than fifty of the Getty Museum's two hundred ninety-five pictures by Atget, with commentary on each image by Gordon Baldwin, associate curator of photographs at the J. Paul Getty Museum. <em>In Focus: Eug�ne Atget</em> also contains a chronological overview of his life and an edited transcript of a colloquium on his career, with participants Baldwin; David Featherstone, independent editor and curator; photographer Robbert Flick, professor of art at the University of Southern California; independent scholar David Harris; Weston Naef, curator of photographs, Getty Museum; Fran�oise Reynaud, curator of photographs at the Mus�e Carnavalet, Paris; and Michael S. Roth, associate director of the Getty Research Institute. This volume of the In Focus series is published to coincide with an exhibit of Atget's images from June 20 through October 18, 2000, at the Getty Museum.</p><p>Born in 1857 in Bordeaux, <b>Eug�ne Atget</b> was the son of a carriage maker, but was soon orphaned and went to live with an uncle. He studied at the Conservatory of the French National Theatre in Paris, and after a number of years working as an actor, he turned to photography at the age of forty-two. He rapidly became absorbed in a documentary project which, over the last thirty years of his life, resulted in more than ten thousand glass-plate negatives of turn-of-the-century Paris and its rural environs. Atget's photographs are now considered early masterpieces of photographic realism. He died in 1927 at the age of seventy in Paris.<br>Text: French, English, German</p><h2>Josiah's Fire: Autism Stole His Words, God Gave Him a Voice (Paperback) &#x2013; Inspirational Book on Overcoming Adversity Through God</h2><p>Where is hope when there is no hope?<br> &nbsp;<br> First-time parents Joe and Tahni Cullen were thrust into the confusing world of autism when their toddler, Josiah, suddenly lost his ability to speak, play, and socialize.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. **<br><br>The Spanish-speaking islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic make up a relatively small region, but their musical and cultural traditions have had a dramatic, sweeping impact on the world.

The author draws on his extensive regional fieldwork, offering accounts of local performances, interviews with key performers, and vivid illustrations.<br> <br>A compelling, comprehensive review, <em>Music in the Hispanic Caribbean</em> is ideal for introductory undergraduate courses in world music or ethnomusicology and for upper-level courses on Caribbean and Latin American music and/or culture.

The goal is to connect with readers, to engage their visual auditory and kinesthetic senses, to stimulate them, and fuel their complete understanding of the topic. As students engage in this multi-sensory experience within these pages, they should remember that we are not encouraging them to merely discover, learn, know, or even understand, the information.

Scott Fitzgerald as the prophet and golden boy of the newly dawned Jazz Age. Published in 1920, when he was just twenty-three, the novel catapulted him to instant fame and financial success. The story of Amory Blaine, a privileged, aimless, and self-absorbed Princeton student, <b>This Side of Paradise</b> closely reflects Fitzgerald's own experiences as an undergraduate. Amory Blaine's journey from prep school to college to the First World War is an account of "the lost generation." The young "romantic egotist" symbolizes what Fitzgerald so memorably described as "a new generation grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken." A pastiche of literary styles, this dazzling chronicle of youth remains bitingly relevant decades later.<br><br>"<b>This Side of Paradise</b> commits almost every sin that a novel can possibly commit," wrote Edmund Wilson. "But it does not commit the unpardonable sin: it does not fail to live. The whole preposterous farrago is animated with life."</p><p>Fitzgerald&#39;s first novel, reprinted in the handsome Everyman&#39;s Library series of literary classic, uses numerous formal experiments to tell the story of Amory Blaine, as he grows up during the crazy years following the First World War. It also contains a new introduction by Craig Raine that describes critical and popular reception of the book when it came out in 1920.F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s This Side of Paradise is the opening statement of his literary career. Published originally in 1920, the novel captures the rhythm and feel of the gaudy decade that was to follow in America. This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald simultaneously famous and infamous: famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing and infamous for the errors--in spelling, fact, grammar, and chronology--that peppered his text. This new edition brings into being an accurate, fully annotated text based on Fitzgerald&#39;s original manuscript.</p><h2>Inside the Music Classroom: Teaching the Art with Heart</h2><p>Calling on more than 26 years of experience, Patricia Bourne explores, in accessible and sincere fashion, this paring of the practical and philosophical in K-6 general music.

An ostentation of peacocks. A murder of crows. The English language brims with witty words for flocks of birds! Thought to have originated from hunting manuals, the practice of inventing collective nouns for birds has since evolved into a sport all its own, with new words striving to perfectly capture the essence of each bird.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>A Conspiracy of Ravens</i> presents readers with a compendium of collective bird nouns from the distant and not-so-distant past. Some of the nouns are portentous, like a tiding of magpies. Others, like a murmuration of starlings or a chattering of choughs, convey sound. Still more reflect with literary flourish the beauty of the bird: what could be more celebratory than a crown of kingfishers or an exaltation of larks? Featuring songbirds, aquatic birds, garden favorites, and birds of prey, this book collects more than one hundred of the best and most imaginative expressions and illustrates them with charming woodcuts by the eighteenth-century artist and naturalist Thomas Bewick.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> A beautiful and entertaining read, <i>A Conspiracy of Ravens</i> will delight bird-lovers and word-lovers in equal measure.</p><p><b>Bill Oddie</b> is a birdwatcher and a broadcaster for the BBC.&#x201c;Collective nouns are always pleasing&#x2014;even when there is little evidence of their having been in close proximity to spoken language. . . .

In recognition for his work the minor planet, 4648 Tirion (1931 UE), is named after him.</p><h2>Sensitive Chaos: The Creation of Flowing Forms in Water and Air</h2><p>Why does water always take a winding course in streams and rivers? Do common principles and rhythms underlie its movement - whether it be in the sea, in a plant, or even in the blood of a human being? In this seminal and thought-provoking work, the laws apparent in the subtle patterns of water in movement are shown to be the same as those perceptible in the shaping of bones, muscles and a myriad of other forms in nature. Fully illustrated, Sensitive Chaos reveals the unifying forces that underlie all living things. The author observes and explains such phenomena as the flight of birds, the formation of internal organs such as the heart, eye and ear, as well as mountain ranges and river deltas, weather and space patterns, and even the formation of the human embryo. A perennial bestseller since publication, Sensitive Chaos is an essential book for anyone interested in the mysteries of life on earth.</p><p>THEODOR SCHWENK (1910 - 1986) was a pioneer in water research. He founded the Institute for Flow Sciences for the scientific study of water&#39;s movement and its life-promoting forces. A prolific writer and lecturer, he contributed original insights to the production of homeopathic and anthroposophic medicines, developed &#39;drop-pictures&#39; for analysing water quality and methods for healing polluted and &#39;dead&#39; water.&#34;So movingly and well told is his tale that you will not want to put the book down until the end.&#34; - James Lovelock &#34;...Theodor Schwenk is a seminal exponent of an alternative reading of nature...

Eugene, MS, BS, <i>Virginia Tech, Doody&#x2019;s Review Service</i></p><h2>Public Philosophy: Essays on Morality in Politics</h2><p>In this book, Michael Sandel takes up some of the hotly contested moral and political issues of our time, including affirmative action, assisted suicide, abortion, gay rights, stem cell research, the meaning of toleration and civility, the gap between rich and poor, the role of markets, and the place of religion in public life. He argues that the most prominent ideals in our political life--individual rights and freedom of choice--do not by themselves provide an adequate ethic for a democratic society. Sandel calls for a politics that gives greater emphasis to citizenship, community, and civic virtue, and that grapples more directly with questions of the good life. Liberals often worry that inviting moral and religious argument into the public sphere runs the risk of intolerance and coercion. These essays respond to that concern by showing that substantive moral discourse is not at odds with progressive public purposes, and that a pluralist society need not shrink from engaging the moral and religious convictions that its citizens bring to public life.</p><p>Michael J. Sandel is Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government at Harvard University.&#x201c;Michael Sandel can always be counted on to write with elegance and intelligence about important things. Whether you agree or not, you cannot ignore his arguments. We need all the sane voices we can get in the public square and Sandel's is one of the sanest.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jean Bethke Elshtain, The University of Chicago Divinity School</b><br><br>&#x201c;No matter what your politics are, you will find Michael<br>Sandel's <i>Public Philosophy</i> exciting, invigorating, discerning and encouraging. Conservatives will discover a liberalism they didn't know existed: profoundly concerned with responsibility, community and the importance of individual virtue. Liberals and Democrats who know their side needs an engaging public philosophy will find its bricks and mortar, its contours and basic principles, right here in these pages. To a political debate that is too often dispiriting and sterile, Sandel has offered a brilliant and badly needed antidote.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>E.J. Dionne Jr., syndicated columnist, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, professor at Georgetown University, author of Why Americans Hate Politics and Stand Up Fight Back</b><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Sandel is one of the world's best known and most influential political theorists. He is unusual for the range of practical ethical issues that he has addressed: life, death, sports, religion, commerce, and more. These essays are lucid, pointed, often highly subtle and revealing. Sandel has something important and worthwhile to say about every topic he addresses.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen Macedo, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Sandel...believes that liberal appeals to individual rights and to the broad values of fairness and equality make a poor case for the progressive case, both as a matter of strategy and as a matter of principle. The country and the Democratic party would be better off, he thinks, if progressives made more of an effort to inspire the majority to adopt their vision of the common good and make it the democratic ground for public policy and law....Anyone concerned over the political success of conservatism in recent years must be interested in this critical analysis.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas Nagel</b><b>, </b><b><i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Sandel] explains that our living in a pluralist society with differing moral ideals does not inhibit our discussion of issues like abortion and stem-cell research but instead helps us resolve them by looking at what it means to live 'a good life.' This thought-provoking book will be valuable to the general reader as well as scholars.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Scott Duimstra</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Are the key values and beliefs that drive democracy in the United States sufficient to cope with our current problems? Since publishing his first book in 1982, Michael Sandel has offered a negative answer to that question by focusing on what he sees as widespread feelings of anxiety emerging from citizens&#x2019; recognition that they are unable to shape either their personal or their collective environments. He roots that pathology in our uncritical acceptance of rights, fairness, and individual choice as the hard parameters of legitimate politics, and proposes instead a return to a pre-liberal perfectionism that emphasizes responsibility, civic duty, and the common good. This new volume, which collects articles previously published between 1983 and 2004, provides a valuable overview of what Sandel calls his &#x201c;public philosophy&#x201d;...His arguments are broad-ranging, lucid, and sincere in their concern for our current public maladies. As such, they demand attention and engagement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Lund</b><b>, </b><b><i>Social Theory and Practice</i></b></p><h2>The Minimalist Program (Current Studies in Linguistics)</h2><p><p><i>The Minimalist Program</i> consists of four recent essays that attempt to situate linguistic theory in the broader cognitive sciences. In these essays the minimalist approach to linguistic theory is formulated and progressively developed. Building on the theory of principles and parameters and, in particular, on principles of economy of derivation and representation, the minimalist framework takes Universal Grammar as providing a unique computational system, with derivations driven by morphological properties, to which the syntactic variation of languages is also restricted. Within this theoretical framework, linguistic expressions are generated by optimally efficient derivations that must satisfy the conditions that hold on interface levels, the only levels of linguistic representation. The interface levels provide instructions to two types of performance systems, articulatory-perceptual and conceptual-intentional. All syntactic conditions, then, express properties of these interface levels, reflecting the interpretive requirements of language and keeping to very restricted conceptual resources.</p><p><b>The Essays<br></b>Principles and Parameters Theory<br>Some Notes on Economy of Derivation and Representation<br>A Minimalist Program for Linguistic Theory<br>Categories and Transformations in a Minimalist Framework</p></p><p>The Minimalist Program consists of four recent essays, including the previously unpublished &#39;Categories and Transformations, &#39; that attempt to situate linguistic theory in the broader cognitive sciences.

They realized that their students were more engaged when they understood how biology directly affected their lives. Colleen and Virginia began to structure their lectures around stories they knew would interest students. When they began letting the story drive the science, they immediately noticed a difference in student interest, energy, and willingness to work harder at learning biology. Not only has this approach increased student understanding, but it has also increased the authors&#x2019; enjoyment in teaching the course&#x2013;presenting students with fascinating stories infused with biological concepts is simply a lot more fun. This approach served to invigorate their teaching.

One of these elements is a box theme called Strategic Management in Action. These boxes describe companies and the unique strategies they're using. Some of the companies portrayed include California Pizza Kitchen, FedEx, VISA USA, Krispy Kreme doughnuts, and E*Trade. Then, there are the FYI (For Your Information) boxes in every chapter that provide a concise overview of current strategic management issues. For example, some of the topics discussed include Corporate Reputations, Are Profits an Outdated Idea?, Why Good Companies Go Bad, The DNA of Corporate Innovation, and so forth. In order to emphasize the global importance of strategic management, there's also a chapter box feature called Strategic Management&#x2014;the Global Perspective. Some of the companies described include Giant Manufacturing Company Ltd. (Taiwan), Nestle SA (Switzerland), and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Finally, because strategic decision makers are often faced with ethical dilemmas, there's an ethics dilemma presented in every chapter under the heading of The Grey Zone. These were written to encourage you to think about the ethical implications inherent in strategic decisions. To make all of these chapter boxed features more relevant, most include suggestions for further research, review, or discussion. Be prepared&#x2014;your professor might make assignments from any of these boxed items! </p><p> Another important change in this textbook is the addition of seven comprehensive cases. These cases include the following: Amazon, Eatertainment Industry, Greeting-Card Industry, Kellogg Company, Levi-Strauss, Southwest Airlines, and Starbucks. These cases were written so you can perform a thorough strategic analysis, identify strategic issues, and develop appropriate strategic choices. Additional cases I have written will be available online starting in the spring semester 2001 and may be assigned by your professor. </p><p> There's no doubt that the realities of the e-business world are having a major impact on organizational strategies. To introduce you to this topic, another new and significant feature in this book reflects the critical importance of understanding e-business and its implications for strategy. To explore e-business concepts, a boxed feature in every chapter called Strategic Management in an E-Business World addresses various aspects of e-business and how strategic decision makers are dealing with the dynamic changes taking place. Some of the topics discussed include choiceboards, Internet taxes, the appropriateness of internal analysis for e-businesses, stock options, and the competitive challenges with selling pet supplies on the Web. In addition, e-business strategies used by different companies are described and discussed. </p><p> Continued from the last edition of the book are several pedagogical tools to help you better learn and understand the concepts and theories of strategic management. For instance, the end-of-chapter Building Your Skills exercises give you the chance to "practice" the skills that successful strategic managers are going to need in tomorrow's organizations. In addition, short end-of-chapter cases (I like to call them case-ettes) provide an opportunity for you to further explore the topic in the chapter. These minicases provide a narrowly focused situation to examine and discuss. One change in this edition is that the chapter-opening Strategic Management in Action case can now be studied in addition to the other end-of-chapter cases. Each chapter also has several Consider This boxes that provide a number of review and discussion questions for a topic section that you've just read. Introduced in the first edition of the book, these boxes offer an excellent way for you to check your comprehension of the material you've just read and are also a great way to review chapter material. Finally, the chapter summaries are presented in a form called The Bottom Line, a term chosen very carefully. When a company focuses on the bottom line; it's focusing on the things that are the most important. Therefore, this section summarizes the important information, including key terms and definitions, in each chapter. </p><p> This edition continues to introduce the most current strategic management theories and practices. Some of these include world-class organizations, the guerrilla view of competitive advantage, online communities, data mining, real options theory, and several others. Of course, the traditional concepts of strategic management such as competitive advantage, SWOT, corporate growth, and strategy implementation are covered as well. </p><p> Another distinguishing feature of Strategic Management in Action retained from the first edition is that the discussion of the various strategy levels (functional, competitive, and corporate) covers formulation, implementation, and evaluation in the respective chapters. Other strategy texts cover strategy formulation in one chapter, implementation in another, and then evaluation in another. I felt that this approach made it hard for readers to see and understand the integrative nature of strategy. So, I decided it made more sense (both from the student's perspective in learning the material and from the professor's perspective in presenting the material) to discuss formulation, implementation, and evaluation as each strategy level was being discussed. So, for instance, when discussing functional strategy, you'll find information on how it's formulated, implemented, and evaluated; and likewise for the competitive and corporate levels, as well. </p><p> Finally, I want to say that I think this book is unique in the market because of its conversational and highly readable writing style. Although an author's writing style is difficult to describe (particularly your own!), I did write this text in a way to, try to make strategy and strategic management clear and understandable&#x2014;yet enjoyable. My teaching philosophy (and I've been teaching for almost 25 years now, have won teaching awards at my university, and am consistently ranked in the top two or three in my department based on student evaluations) has been that education can be fun! So, I write like I teach. But only you, the reader, can ultimately judge how well I've written the material. </p><p> I need to thank a number of people for their contributions to this book. Without them, Strategic Management in Action, 2nd edition wouldn't be a reality. First of all are my students&#x2014;current and past. Through my experiences (most of them enjoyable!) teaching our Strategic Management course, I've developed my own personal philosophy of what's worked and what hasn't. I learn things every semester from my students, and I hope they're learning from me. Then, I'd like to say "Thanks" to my department head, Barry Wisdom, and my college dean, Ron Bottin. Thank you for your support and encouragement. And then, of course, are my departmental secretaries, Carol Hale and Anita Looney. Thank you for all you do to make my life easier. </p><p> I would also like to recognize the individuals who provided me with intelligent and thorough reviews of the first edition of Strategic Management in Action. I appreciate your willingness to provide thorough and thought-provoking reviews. I know the second edition is better because of the suggestions you have provided. These individuals are Dr. William P Anthony, Florida State University; Dr. Jeryl L. Nelson, Wayne State College; Jerry Thomas, Arapahoe Community College; Patrick L. Schultz, Texas Tech.

Revealing strategic management through interviews with managers and current examples, Strategic Management in Action integrates its discussion of different levels of strategy (i.e., functional, competitive, and corporate) with the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of each of those strategies. The book presents the latest strategic management theories and practices and demonstrates that organizational actions such as downsizing are really strategy in action. It also emphasizes that business strategy is a concern for all employees in an organization. An essential reference book for any professional at any level in an organization.</p><h2>Cengage Advantage Books: World History, Volume I</h2><p>Developed to meet the demand for a low-cost, high-quality history book, this economically priced version of WORLD HISTORY, 8th Edition offers readers the complete narrative with only the most essential features, photos, and maps.

Eventually, in search of a brighter future, Ada moves to Paris and makes a living painting scenes from the world she has left behind. Harry Sinner also comes to Paris to mingle in exclusive circles, until one day he buys two paintings which remind him of his past and the course of Ada's life changes once more.<br><br>But then recession and revolutions shake previously rich regimes. As summer draws to a close, Ada's world is disintegrating, and she is faced with a fateful decision.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>IR�NE N�MIROVSKY was born in Kiev in 1903, the daughter of a Jewish banker. In 1918 her family fled the Russian Revolution for France where she became a bestselling novelist, author of <b>David Golder</b>, <b>Le Bal</b>, <b>The Courilof Affair</b>, <b>All Our Worldly Goods</b> and other works published in her lifetime or soon after, as well as of the recent posthumously published <b>Suite Fran�aise</b> and <b>Fire in the Blood</b>. <b>The Dogs and the Wolves</b>, now appearing for the first time in English, was published in France in spring 1940, just months before France fell to the Nazis. N�mirovsky died in Auschwitz in 1942.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"<b>The Dogs and the Wolves</b> is a bitter, angry book reflecting nastiness between Jews, as well as the prejudice and persecution they suffered in France between the world wars... the novel builds towards a final scene of redemptive tenderness: a piercing note of compassion and hope after all the grimness that N�mirovsky has exposed with characteristic boldness." <br>--Ruth Scurr, <i>The Times</i><br><br>"Written with tremendous assurance and finess, <b>The Dogs and the Wolves</b> is an outstanding achievement of European fiction." <br>--Peter Kemp, <i>Sunday Times</i><br><br>"Nemirovsky was incapable of producing anything less than an enchanting novel. She has an irresistible talent for creating character and incident which makes this story as much a page-turner as anything she has written." <br>--Carmen Callil, <i>Guardian</i><br><br>"A sad and beautifully written tale." <br>--Caroline Moorehead, <i>Literary Review</i></p><h2>Mosses of Eastern North America (2 Volume Set)</h2><p>This represents 25 years of work and close collaboration between the authors and gives a detailed taxonomic treatment of and identification guide to the mosses of the Eastern Deciduous Forest of North America.

More than 500,000 definitions grace its 3,984 pages, and its innovative, open design makes this vast amount of information easily navigable and identifiable. The Shorter covers virtually every word or phrase in use in English--worldwide--since 1700. Drawing on the continuous research for The Oxford English Dictionary, each definition&#39;s changing meanings are followed throughout history and are illustrated by more than 83,000 quotations from some 7,000 authors. The world&#39;s most comprehensive, thorough, and up-to-date unabridged dictionary, the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is an essential resource for every library.</p><p>The Editor-In-Chief, Lesley Brown, brings over twenty year's experience of historical lexicography to the project. Her team numbered at its height sixteen lexicographers, plus numerous researchers and advisors. Bill Trumble is Projects Manager for English Dictionaries and Thesauruses at Oxford<br>University Press.Considering it was 20 years between the third and fourth editions of this work, this "abridgement" of Oxford's flagship OED after fewer than 10 years is most welcome. Given some of the advance publicity and advertisements, Oxford is clearly aware that to win in the dictionary wars (at least in the eyes of the general public), it is necessary to emphasize newer words added to the dictionary. The general coverage of the volumes remains largely unchanged from the fourth edition, however, even retaining the previous edition's preface and adding a briefer preface for the current edition. Still, some welcome changes have been made.<p>Like the previous edition, this work "sets out the main meanings and semantic developments of words current at any time between 1700 and the present day." Words such as <i>achtande, knottle,</i> or <i>pompal</i> (all present in <i>OED Online</i>) that are obsolete, obsolete variations, or rare are therefore not included. Words obsolete by 1700 are still included, however, if used by authors such as Shakespeare or other "influential literary sources." Headwords are traced back to their earliest usage. The dust jacket from the work claims it has "more than one third of the coverage of the <i>OED"</i> and more than half a million definitions, with 83,500 illustrative quotations from 7,000 authors. Although the preface does not cite the number of new entries, publicity from Oxford states that 3,500 new words have been added to this edition. An actual headword count is not given, though the publisher's Web site puts the number at 97,600.</p><p>The most welcome change to this edition is that the text is much easier on the eyes than in the fourth edition. Most notably, the illustrative quotations are placed within a tinted text box, making them very easy to spot. In the main entries, each definition sense is now started on a new line in clear, bold numbers (the older edition had all the senses grouped together in one paragraph), and etymologies are spelled out, with <i>Old English</i> or <i>Middle Low German</i> replacing the fourth edition's <i>OE</i> or <i>MLG,</i> respectively. Addressing a criticism RBB had of the fourth edition, abbreviations are now within regular alphabetical order rather than placed at the beginning of the alphabet.</p><p>Unfortunately, one thing the <i>Shorter OED</i> has not changed is its tradition of abbreviating dates of first use--and, when needed, of last use--for a headword (<i>L19</i> for late-nineteenth century, <i>M20</i> for mid-twentieth century). Because even collegiate dictionaries now routinely spell out a date range for first use, it is time Oxford adopted a similar approach. It would also be useful to attach a date to the illustrative quotations used rather than just citing the author.</p><p>With both <i>OED Online</i> and the print <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> too expensive for many libraries, this is a reasonably priced work that includes the requisite neologisms (<i>Bollywood,</i> <i>full monty,</i> and <i>phat,</i> among others) to make it a <i>goof-proof</i> purchase for all libraries, even those owning the parent work. The <i>Shorter OED</i> has some entries <i>(Jedi, Klingon</i>, and <i>warp drive)</i> that are not even included in <i>OED </i>Online. In short, this is one <i>badass</i> dictionary deserving a place in almost every library. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It emphasizes the practices and procedures of real estate and stresses the operational and mechanical steps in the transaction such as the buying and selling; the review and assessment of title, the preparation of Deeds and Mortgages, and the preparation and completion of the settlement.

Nemeth</b>, Professor, Director of Graduate Legal Studies and the university&#x2019;s <i>Institute for Law and Public Policy</i>, has spent his professional life engaged in the study of jurisprudence, the correlation of morality to law, ethics, and the relevance of classical and medieval thought in contemporary legal and judicial practice. A recognized expert on morality and legal ethics, appellate legal practice and private-sector justice, he is a prolific writer, having published numerous texts and articles on law and justice throughout his impressive career. His well regarded, <i>Aquinas in the</i> <i>Courtroom</i> (Greenwood and Praeger Press 2001) is considered a work of immense originality since it prompts readers to find the Thomistic ethic as a recipe for justice.&nbsp; Other recent works include:<i> Private</i> <i>Sector Justice</i> (Prentice Hall 2005) <i>Criminal Law</i> (Prentice Hall, 2003), <i>Law &amp; Evidence: A Primer for Criminal Justice, Criminology, Law, and Legal Studies</i> (Prentice Hall, 2001) and <i>Private Security and the Law</i> (Elsevier 2005). The bevy of peer reviewed publications manifest this unquenchable thirst for examining modern moral, ethical and legal dilemmas in law in light of perennial philosophical truths, as espoused by Augustine, Aquinas and others.&nbsp; Works include commentaries on the role of judges and lawyers in Thomistic thought, the efficacy and morality of hiring quotas, the invasiveness of polygraphs, the decriminalization of child sexual offenses and a critique of good and evil in sociological and criminological circles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Nemeth also serves the university as Director of the Institute of Law and Public Policy- a think-tank that sponsors regional and national forums, a university press, a myriad of publications and continuing education activities for the university and surrounding community.&nbsp; Subjects covered in the Institute&#x2019;s publications include the role of religion in judicial reasoning, a critique of precedent in the United States Supreme Court&#x2019;s overturn of criminalized sodomy, and the tension between terrorism and privacy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An educator for more than 30 years, Nemeth&#x2019;s distinctive career is grounded in an exemplary education, including a Master of Laws from George Washington University, a Juris Doctor from the University of Baltimore, and a Master of Arts and Ph.D. in Philosophy from Duquesne University.&nbsp; In addition, he was awarded a MS from Niagara University and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware.&nbsp; He holds memberships in the New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania Bars. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>His previous academic appointments, both full and part-time, include Niagara University (1977-1980), the University of Baltimore (1980-1981), Glassboro State College (1981-1986), St. Joseph&#x2019;s University (1985-1988), Chatham College (1993-1997), Waynesburg College (1988-1998) and the State University of New York at Brockport (1998-2003). </p></p><h2>Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World</h2><p><p>Lionel Casson's encyclopedic study is the first of its kind to use underwater archaeological data to refine and area of scholarship that had, for the most part, relied on ancient texts and graphic representations. Tracing the history of early ships and seamanship from pre-dynastic Egypt to the Roman empire, from skiffs and barges to huge oared warships and royal yachts, Casson describes not only the ships themselves, but also the make-up and training of the crews, placement of weaponry, how cargo was stored, methods of navigation, harbor facilities, and the ways ships were named.</p></p><p><p><b>Lionel Casson </b> is professor emeritus of classics at New York University.

Carthaginians, Romans, vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, TUrks, French and Italians have all occupied the region in their time.<br>The Romans governed this part of Africa for six hundred cities, twelve thousand miles of roads and hundreds of aquaducts, some fifty miles long.

Drawing together a vast body of empirical research in cognitive science, linguistics, and developmental psychology, Tomasello demonstrates that we don&#x2019;t need a self-contained &#x201c;language instinct&#x201d; to explain how children learn language. Their linguistic ability is interwoven with other cognitive abilities.</p><p>Tomasello argues that the essence of language is its symbolic dimension, which rests on the uniquely human ability to comprehend intention. Grammar emerges as the speakers of a language create linguistic constructions out of recurring sequences of symbols; children pick up these patterns in the buzz of words they hear around them.</p><p>All theories of language acquisition assume these fundamental skills of intention-reading and pattern-finding. Some formal linguistic theories posit a second set of acquisition processes to connect somehow with an innate universal grammar. But these extra processes, Tomasello argues, are completely unnecessary&#x2015;important to save a theory but not to explain the phenomenon.</p><p>For all its empirical weaknesses, Chomskian generative grammar has ruled the linguistic world for forty years. <i>Constructing a Language</i> offers a compellingly argued, psychologically sound new vision for the study of language acquisition.</p></p><p>Michael Tomasello is Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University. From 1998 to 2018 he was Co-Director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and in 2017 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His scientific work has been recognized by institutions around the world, including the Guggenheim Foundation, the British Academy, the Royal Academy of Netherlands, and the German National Academy of Sciences.&#x201c;<i>Constructing a Language</i> is the best book on language development since Roger Brown's <i>A First Language</i>. Tomasello has taken full advantage of the research that has been done in the thirty years since Brown's landmark book, to give us a full account of language acquisition, from the first signs of intentional communication in prespeech through the most complex syntactic constructions children produce. The book rebuilds bridges between child language and linguistic theory -- but in place of generative grammar, Tomasello ties the study of emergent language to a usage-based approach derived from cognitive and functional linguistics. He is particularly persuasive in showing how it solves the essential problem of how children "get from here to there," as they move by analogy from item-based phrases and word islands to richer constructions. Tomasello's book presents a comprehensive and well-articulated theory of the language-learning process<br>that is more complete and richer in its heuristic value than any other attempt of its kind. It will be difficult to refute and impossible to ignore.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Elizabeth Bates, University of California at San Diego</b><br><br>&#x201c;Certain to be a landmark in the language sciences, this book persuasively argues that all of our fundamental knowledge of language can be "learned" on the basis of what we hear, with recourse only to general basic cognitive abilities: intention reading and pattern-finding. No hard-wired "language instinct" is required. Tomasello's synthesis of linguistics and psychology will permanently change the debates about the developmental origins of language.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adele Goldberg, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b><br><br>&#x201c;Tomasello offers an extended and detailed exposition of his 'usage-based' theory of language acquisition, which he contrasts to nativist or 'universal grammar' theories such as those of Noam Chomsky and of Steven Pinker...Throughout this masterfully written but stylistically and intellectually dense book, Tomasello reports extensively on current research and looks critically at the assumptions and assertions of his contemporaries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>L.

This book presents a significant body of previously unpublished pictures by Arbus and proposes a radically new way to understand her goals, strategies, and overall work. Diane Arbus: Family Albums examines unknown contact sheets from several of Arbus&#39;s portrait sessions, including more than three hundred photographs she took of a New York family one weekend in 1969. Anthony W. Lee and John Pultz put to the test Arbus&#39;s claim that she was developing a &#34;family album.&#34; They present other images Arbus shot for Esquire magazine (including pictures of the families of Ricky Nelson, Jayne Mansfield, and Ogden Reid) and discuss her interest in photographic groupings of both traditional and alternative families. Challenging common interpretations of Arbus, the authors reveal a photographer far more savvy with the camera, more aware of photography as an artistic and commercial practice, and more sensitive to the social and cultural tensions of the 1960s than has been acknowledged before.</p><p>This book accompanies an exhibition at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum (September 2 to December 7, 2004); Grey Gallery, New York University (January 13 to March 27, 2004); Portland Museum of Art, Maine (June 5 to September 6, 2004); the Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas (October 16, 2004 to January 16, 2005); and other venues to be announced.

She gathered her household together and set off with her husband, her housekeeper and her small dogs on a four-month tour of Italy. Her articles were published in 1904 as Italian Villas and their Gardens. One of the first books to treat the subject of Italian garden architecture seriously, it influenced a generation of garden writers and landscape architects. Nearly 100 years later, photographer and writer Vivian Russell set out on her own odyssey, following Edith Wharton&#39;s footsteps around Italy to photograph the best surviving gardens from her book and to tell the story of how each one was made. her lively text describes the patrons and architects who created the gardens and explores their hidden symbolic meaning.</p><p>Though most know her as the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of novels such as <i>The Age of Innocence</i> and <i>The House of Mirth</i>, Edith Wharton was also something of a doyenne of domestic taste, and fortunately neither a nearsighted nor a parochial one. She published the first serious treatment of Italian garden architecture, <i><i>Italian Villas and Their Gardens</i></i>, in 1904. A lifelong Italophile as well as a lifelong gardener herself, Wharton had an instinctive attraction to both the clipped precision and the sensuous disarray that characterize an Italian villa garden. Nineteen of the gardens Wharton and her illustrator Maxfield Parrish brought to public attention are virtually unchanged by the passage of the single century since her descriptions were written. Garden photographer and writer Vivian Russell has recaptured both the essence of the gardens themselves and Wharton's experience of them in a series of luscious photographs and historical summaries of each garden. The Villa Cetinale, pictured on the cover from the vantage point of its lemon garden, was singled out by Wharton for its charm and its long green park, marked by a 15th-century gateway at one end and a <i>romitorio</i>, or hermitage, at the other.<p> The book's considerable charm lies in the historical perspective it affords of Wharton and her Victorian colleagues as well as the many centuries borne so gracefully by the beautiful land they loved. It's a marvelous homage to Wharton and a must-read for all lovers of things Italian.</p>VIVIAN RUSSELL is a writer and photographer. She has written three other books on Monet - Monet&#39;s Landscapes, Monet&#39;s Waterlilies, and Planting Schemes for Monet&#39;s Garden.

In <i>Japan-ness in Architecture</i>, he identifies what is essentially Japanese in architecture from the seventh to the twentieth century. In the opening essay, Isozaki analyzes the struggles of modern Japanese architects, including himself, to create something uniquely Japanese out of modernity. He then circles back in history to find what he calls Japan-ness in the seventh-century Ise shrine, reconstruction of the twelfth-century Todai-ji Temple, and the seventeenth-century Katsura Imperial Villa. He finds the periodic ritual relocation of Ise's precincts a counter to the West's concept of architectural permanence, and the repetition of the ritual an alternative to modernity's anxious quest for origins. He traces the "constructive power" of the Todai-ji Temple to the vision of the director of its reconstruction, the monk Chogen, whose imaginative power he sees as corresponding to the revolutionary turmoil of the times. The Katsura Imperial Villa, with its chimerical spaces, achieved its own Japan-ness as it reinvented the traditional shoin style. </p><p>And yet, writes Isozaki, what others consider to be the Japanese aesthetic is often the opposite of that essential Japan-ness born in moments of historic self-definition; the purified stylization&#x2015;what Isozaki calls "Japanesquization"&#x2015;lacks the energy of cultural transformation and reflects an island retrenchment in response to the pressure of other cultures.</p><p>Combining historical survey, critical analysis, theoretical reflection, and autobiographical account, these essays, written over a period of twenty years, demonstrate Isozaki's standing as one of the world's leading architects and preeminent architectural thinkers.</p></p><p>Arata Isosaki is a leading Japanese architect. His works include the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, the Volksbank Center am Postdamer Platz in Berlin, the Team Disney Building in Orlando, and the Tokyo University of Art and Design."Iconoclastic and erudite, opinionated and insightful, wily and contrarian--this exciting book should be widely read not only by architects, but by anyone interested in Japan. Isozaki's essays are at once autobiographical and oracular; the collection, written over decades and discussing buildings spanning centuries, establishes his personal struggle with being Japanese in a global era as one that offers provocative insight into the culture of Japan yesterday, today, and tomorrow."--Dana Buntrock, Department of Architecture, University of California, Berkeley<br><br>"Drawing on both his own extensive experience as a practicing architect and a broad grasp of world history, Arata Isozaki takes on the century-old debate over what is (or should be) 'Japanese' about Japanese architecture. This self-reflective critique is fresh and timely, and in the process provides provocative arguments about the shape of all Japanese history."--Henry D.

If only it were that simple. To make matters worse, certain treatments assume you've somehow contributed to the problem and prohibit you from taking an active role. But as you watch your own teen struggle with a life-threatening illness, every fiber of your being tells you there must be some part you can play in restoring your child's health. In <i>Help Your Teenager Beat an Eating Disorder</i>, James Lock and Daniel Le Grange--two of the nation's top experts on the treatment of eating disorders--present compelling evidence that your involvement as a parent is critical. In fact, it may be the key to conquering your child's illness. <i>Help Your Teenager Beat an Eating Disorder</i> provides the tools you need to build a united family front that attacks the illness to ensure that your child develops nourishing eating habits and life-sustaining attitudes, day by day, meal by meal. Full recovery takes time, and relapse is common. But whether your child has already entered treatment or you're beginning to suspect there is a problem, the time to act is now.

Accompanying a major exhibition, this profusely illustrated survey of his life in art traces his inspirations, rooted both in traditional American tattooing of the first half of the twentieth century and in the imagery of Japan's ukiyo-e era. Hardy, raised in Southern California, became intrigued with tattoo art at the age of ten, setting up shop in his parents' den. After attending the San Francisco Art Institute in the 1960s, he rejected a graduate fellowship from Yale to apprentice at studios up and down the West Coast. It was his intention to rescue tattooing from its subculture, "outsider" status and elevate it to at least the level of folk art.<br><br>Hardy's success at breathing new life into the art form is chronicled in a plethora of tattoo designs, paintings, drawings, prints, and three-dimensional work spanning fifty years. While the world that inspires him may be lost, Hardy's distinct visual language is vibrantly alive within American visual vernacular, synonymous to some with the spirit of the West Coast itself.</p><p><b>Karin Breuer</b> is the curator in charge of the Achenbach Foundation of Graphic Arts at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. <br><b>Sherry Fowler </b>is an art historian specializing in Japanese Buddhist art at the University of Kansas.<br><b>Jeff Gunderson</b> is librarian and archivist at the San Francisco Art Institute. <br><b>Don Ed Hardy</b> is a legend in the tattoo world. <br><b>Joel Selvin</b> is a San Francisco-based music critic and author.</p><h2>All the Light We Cannot See</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

It does when the novel is as inventive and beautiful as this one by Anthony Doerr. In fact, <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>--while set mostly in Germany and France before and during the war--is not really a &#x201c;war novel&#x201d;. Yes, there is fear and fighting and disappearance and death, but the author&#x2019;s focus is on the interior lives of his two characters. Marie Laure is a blind 14-year-old French girl who flees to the countryside when her father disappears from Nazi-occupied Paris. Werner is a gadget-obsessed German orphan whose skills admit him to a brutal branch of Hitler Youth. Never mind that their paths don&#x2019;t cross until very late in the novel, this is not a book you read for plot (although there is a wonderful, mysterious subplot about a stolen gem). This is a book you read for the beauty of Doerr&#x2019;s writing-- &#x201c;Abyss in her gut, desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of the cans of food...&#x201d;--and for the way he understands and cherishes the magical obsessions of childhood. Marie Laure and Werner are never quaint or twee. Instead they are powerful examples of the way average people in trying times must decide daily between morality and survival. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Anthony Doerr is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i>.

In a lively and lucid manner, it brings together a great deal of material in spherical trigonometry that is necessary to understand plate tectonics and the research literature written about it. It is intended for use in first year graduate courses in geophysics and tectonics, and provides a guide to the quantitative understanding of plate tectonics.</p><p>This book is intended for the reader whose imagination has been captured by reading a popular account about the plate tectonics and would like to know more. It concentrates on the quantitative side of the plate tectonics because most scientifically literate people are already familiar with the quantitative side.

It offers a meta-language of signs and symbols that communicate their meaning precisely. Yet the true origins of the Tarot remain shrouded in mystery. These oracular cards have long been thought to have come from Egypt or from the &#x201c;Gypsies,&#x201d; but as Stephen E. Flowers reveals, their original roots lie in the Mithraic tradition of the Persian Magi. <br><br>In this book, Flowers explores the historical roots and mythology of the symbolic images that became known as the Tarot. Drawing on theories first pioneered by the Swedish scholar Sigurd Agrell (1881-1937), he reveals the genesis of the Tarot&#x2019;s symbolism in the great Hermetic tradition at the same time the Magical Papyri were being written in Greco-Roman Egypt. He explains how the sequencing of the Major Arcana is related to the images used in Mithraic initiation, elements of which were then integrated into existing Roman and Egyptian traditions. Exploring the Magian teachings on the Stoeicheia, an alphabet that acted as a map for understanding the order of the cosmos, he demonstrates how this alphabet of magical symbols was the template for the Tarot. The author also shows how the 22 Major Arcana cards were related to the 22 letters of the Roman alphabet used for oracular purposes in ancient times. Looking in-depth at the principles of Mithraism, the author explains how the Roman form of Mithraism, a guiding factor in the early shaping of the Tarot, was itself a synthesis of Iranian Magianism, Greek stoicism, Babylonian astrology, and Greco-Egyptian Hermeticism. <br><br>Exploring the cards themselves, Flowers then looks at the original meanings of the Major Arcana using Mithraic symbolism and its offshoots. He also explains the truth behind many of the myths surrounding the Tarot, including their deep-level connections with Egypt, the Romani people, the Semitic tradition, and runes. By restoring the original mysteria to the icons of the Tarot and learning their true origins, we can better understand the insight these powerful cards impart in divination.</p><p>Stephen Flowers studied Germanic and Celtic philology and religious history at the University of Texas at Austin and in Goettingen, West Germany. He received his Ph.D. in 1984 in Germanic Languages and Medieval Studies with a dissertation entitled <i>Runes and Magic</i>.<b>Chapter 4. The Magian Tarok <br><i>Symbolism of the Major Arcana <br><br></i></b>The Tarot, as it surfaced in the late Middle Ages, was not the <i>beginning</i>, but rather the end, of a long process of development and transformation. There are a number of clues we can use to reconstruct the oldest imagery of the original Roman &#x201c;Tauroc,&#x201d; which can in turn act as the basis for a possible recovery of the imagery of the two &#x201c;lost cards&#x201d; of the prototypical and hypothetical &#x201c;Greek Taurok.&#x201d; <br><br>From a historical perspective one of the most fascinating aspects of the study of these images is that the icons are drawn from such a wide range of sources. Many of the main elements are derived from the Iranian Mithraic (or Magian) stream of thought, or from the Semitic Mesopotamian tradition, or from Egyptian mythology and religion--as well as from the primary Greek and Roman traditions. But less well known elements are also especially strongly represented. Old and suppressed, or officially ignored, gods and goddesses of Rome figure prominently, e.g. Orcus and Libera, while Greek elements are often those which were imported at some time from originally non-Greek realms (such as Hekat� from Thrace). The reasons for this openness to suppressed material is that the Mithraic and Magian tradition was falling increasingly into this category in the West itself. The Mithraic cult became a clearing-house for all kinds of ideas being driven progressively more underground by the establishment of orthodox Christianity. <br><br>The interpretive comments offered on each of the Tarok images below are drawn from a variety of sources, but they cannot pretend to be exhaustive. Readers are invited to review material found elsewhere in this book, especially where the symbolism of the magical disk of Pergamon or the lore of the individual Greek <i>stoicheia</i> are outlined, to discover for themselves hidden links between the Roman system of Arcana and some of the older traditions. The discovery of the Greek letter which corresponds to each of the Roman Arcana is often essential in reconnecting the Arcanum in question to the deepest levels of mystery. <br><br><i>Apis <br>The Fool <br>A = 1 [0] <br></i><br>The general image of The Fool is that of what appears to be a court jester wandering in the countryside with a bundle on a stick. He is often being bitten on the leg or elsewhere by a dog. In the Gringonneur deck the man has the ears of a bull or some other animal. This is perhaps explained in the origin of the name of the image and the whole series of images discussed below. <br><br>The name (<i>Il Matto</i> in Italian and &#x201c;The Fool&#x201d; in English) is universal in its implications. Originally there were only three cards called &#x201c;trumps&#x201d;: The Fool, The Magician and The World. Each of these are worth five points in the game of Tarock. The word &#x201c;trump&#x201d; has its origin in the Latin word <i>triumphus</i>, but influenced by the word <i>triumviri</i> &#x201c;three men.&#x201d; It was before these &#x201c;three men,&#x201d; the triumvirate, that the triumphal victory marches in Rome were made. In the symbolic language of the Tarot these &#x201c;three men&#x201d; were the human figures represented in the three cards in question, which came at the beginning and end of the sequence of images. <br><br>In fact, as mentioned earlier, the name of the whole system my stem from the original name for this, the first image. Agrell pointed out that a French Proven�al word <i>taruc</i>, derived from the Latin <i>taurus</i>, &#x201c;bull,&#x201d; means &#x201c;a stupid person,&#x201d; a &#x201c;bull-headed&#x201d; person-- a &#x201c;fool.&#x201d; Even more evocative is the idea that the name of the whole system is derived from the Greek term, later Romanized, for the Mithraic &#x201c;bull slaying&#x201d;: <i>tauroktonia</i>. This act of bull sacrifice is, of course, responsible for the inception of the natural generative and regenerative universe, it is the beginning of all developing or evolving things. Therefore, from a Mithraic viewpoint it is the beginning of the series of evolutionary and initiatory images, and a description of the whole series as well. This is much like naming a series of letters after its beginning: <i>alpha-beta</i>, ABC, futhark, etc. <br><br>The original number of this image was one. The later assignation of the number zero to the image is a modern affectation. The Number One, as a pure <i>quality</i> (not a quantity), contained most of the connotations zero has for modern mind. Oneness contains everything and is therefore the virtual equivalent of nothing. <br><br>The Roman-Mithraic name of this image for divinatory purposes should be one that begins with an &#x201c;A.&#x201d; This name would have been readily available to the Romans of the time in the form of the name of the Egyptian divine bull of the Sun: Apis. Apis was very well-known in the ancient world. This is what Agrell assigned to the icon in question here. However, it is my thought that this word, Apis, contains a great mystery. The Latin word apis also means &#x201c;bee.&#x201d; This is a symbol for the <i>Mazmaga</i> -- the &#x201c;Great Fellowship&#x201d; of initiates responsible for spreading the philosophy of Zarathustra and for insinuating elements of it into other systems. The Fool is most often an (at first) unwitting initiate into this invisible realm of wisdom. <br><br>The original image was probably that of the complete Mithraic &#x201c;bull-slaying&#x201d; (tauroktonie), although for divinatory purposes the image was probably no more than the horns of a bull, perhaps with a dog depicted below the horns. When we look at a complete depiction of the tauroctony we see Mithras stabbing the bull with a knife, while he is looking away -- in disgust or ignorance of the consequences of his action -- as a dog licks the blood dripping from the wound. A scorpion is stinging and attempting to devour the bull&#x2019;s testicles, below the whole scene slithers a snake, and above it hover images of the Sun and Moon, as well as the entire zodiac. This one scene prefigures many of the major images of the Tauroc series.</p><h2>Cultural Theory and Popular Culture</h2><p><p>The new 4th edition of John Storey&#x2019;s successful reader in <i>Cultural Theory and Popular Culture</i> is a companion volume to <i>Cultural Theory and Popular Culture: An Introduction</i>, now in its 5th edition.

The authors used Vangstad's experience to construct a model of a school counselor in action and provide a broad framework for thinking and working like one. Through the study of this example, students are encouraged to evaluate their own beliefs, values, vision, and identity. <br> <br> Individual chapters include additional research to reinforce techniques and help students develop and use effective strategies. Each author provides a different theoretical perspective at the end of the chapter, focusing on either a counseling framework or a systems and developmental framework. A section entitled <i>New Horizons</i> provides suggestions for application of the ideas presented. <br> <br> Designed to supplement any school counseling course, this book: <br> *is the first comprehensive portrait of the multi-faceted responsibilities of a real school counselor and an inspiring model for positive change in schools; <br> *presents a special focus on the role that group work plays in changing a culture; <br> *provides a mosaic of field-tested ideas, options, and concepts from an experienced counselor; <br> *places emphasis on the importance of school culture and the community context, as well as the socialization function of a comprehensive counseling program; and <br> *offers assistance to students in developing and using effective strategies, techniques, frameworks, and change-enhancing language.<br></p><p>John M.

Written for anyone with a little Perl experience, Damian Conway's <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> provides an invaluable guide to virtually every aspect of object-oriented programming in Perl.<p> The most notable thing about <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> is Conway's excellent perspective on object-oriented concepts and how they are implemented in Perl. This book does a remarkable job of cutting through traditional jargon and illustrating how basic object-oriented design techniques are handled in Perl. (A useful appendix attests to the author's wide-ranging knowledge, with a comparison of Smalltalk, Eiffel, C++, and Java with Perl, including a summary of object-oriented syntax for each.) This book also features a truly excellent review of basic Perl syntax.</p><p> Throughout this text, the author shows you the basics of solid object design (illustrated using classes that model music CDs). Basic concepts like inheritance and polymorphism get thorough and clear coverage. The book also points out common mistakes and provides many tips for navigating the powerful and flexible (yet sometimes tricky) nuances of using Perl objects. For instance, Conway shows how to achieve true data encapsulation in Perl (which generally allows calls across modules) as well as its natural support for generic programming techniques. </p><p> He also pays special attention to popular object modules available from CPAN (like <i>Class::MethodmakerK</i>, which simplifies declaring classes) and discusses performance issues and the tradeoff between programming convenience and speed often faced by today's Perl developer. Advanced chapters cover a number of techniques for adding persistence and invoking methods using multiple dispatching.</p><p> Filled with syntactic tips and tricks, <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> is a sure bet for any programmer who wants to learn how to use Perl objects effectively. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Perl language review, CPAN, Perl objects, 'blessing' and inheritance, polymorphism, Class::Struct and Class::Methodmaker modules, Perl ties and closures, operator overloading, encapsulation, multiple dispatch, Class::Multimethods, coarse-grained and fine-grained object persistence techniques, performance issues.</p><p>Dr. Damian Conway is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Monash University (Melbourne, Australia), where he teaches object-oriented software engineering. He is an effective teacher, an accomplished writer, and the author of several popular Perl modules. He is also a semi-regular contributor to the Perl Journal. In 1998 he was the winner of the Larry Wall Award for Practical Utility for two modules (Getopt::Declare and Lingua::EN::Inflect) and in 1999 he won his second ""Larry"" for his Coy.pm haiku-generation module.</p></p><h2>Neuropsychological Assessment</h2><p>Well-known as the "bible" in its field, this text/reference has been thoroughly revised and updated by a team of internationally recognized and clinically experienced neuropsychologists. Drawing on their diverse interests, they provide authoritative, broad-based, and in-depth coverage of current research and clinical practice in neuropsychology. They have not, however, changed the book's overall organization. The first eight chapters present the knowledge base for understanding the principles and practice of patient-oriented, hypothesis-testing neuropsychological assessment. The last 12 chapters review nearly all tests and assessment techniques discussed in previous editions plus many new ones and recent revisions of older tests. The extent of the updating is apparent from the fact that approximately half of the more than 7,000 references cited appeared since the last edition was published.<br>Many new topics relevant to current assessment practices have been added to the 4th edition. The chapter on examination procedures, for example, now contains sections on cognitive functioning in pain and PTSD patients. The chapter on brain disorders includes new material on electrical/lighting injuries, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders, and both medical and psychological treatments. The discussion of assessment procedures has been updated throughout to cover recently published test batteries used in general neuropsychological assessment (e.g., mental abilities, memory), newly developed batteries for specific issues (e.g., frontal lobe evaluation), and recent research on older neuropsychological assessment batteries. The fully revised chapter on assessing response bias describes and evaluates more than 60 tests, test combinations, and other measures for detecting questionable effort within the context of forensic neuropsychological assessment.</p><p>Muriel D.

This, according to Russell, is where the work of philosophy begins. He covers topics such as reality, the nature of matter, inductive reasoning, truth, and the limits of philosophical knowledge. </p><p> As one of the greatest minds in Western philosophy, Russell's thoughts are profoundly informative and provocative and suitable for anyone wishing to expand his mind.</p>Bertrand Arthur William Russell, (1872-1970) was an English philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, and social critic. Although he spent the majority of his life in England, he was born in Wales, where he also died. Russell led the British &#34;revolt against idealism&#34; in the early 1900s. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his prot�g� Wittgenstein and his elder Frege, and is widely held to be one of the 20th century&#39;s most important logicians.</p><h2>Mental Disorders in Older Adults: Fundamentals of Assessment and Treatment</h2><p>Illustrated with abundant clinical material, this book provides essential knowledge and skills for effective mental health practice with older adults. It demonstrates how to evaluate and treat frequently encountered clinical problems in this population, including dementias, mood and anxiety disorders, and paranoid symptoms. Strategies are presented for implementing psychosocial interventions and integrating them with medications. The book also describes insightful approaches for supporting family caregivers and addresses the nuts and bolts of consulting in institutional settings. Combining their expertise as a researcher and an experienced clinician, the authors offer a unique perspective on the challenges facing older adults and how to help them lead more fulfilling and independent lives.

I will recommend it equally to clinical psychologists-in-training and to experienced colleagues, and will use it with our psychology undergraduates taking elective courses in this field. I found the use of numerous detailed case studies most helpful in bringing to life the research and theory. There is so much clinical wisdom in this book that reading it is comparable to a supervision session with a really experienced clinician. The tone of the book is refreshing: optimism and hope emerge from every page, grounded in a realistic appraisal of what can be achieved and in respect for the value of each older person and his or her caregivers."--Bob Woods, Professor of Clinical Psychology with Older People, University of Wales, Bangor, UK <br><br>"This second edition is an extraordinary guide for clinical professionals and graduate trainees who work with aging populations. The authors succeed in integrating clinical and research information in a highly readable, clinically relevant format. The case examples address the rich complexity of clinical psychology practice with aging populations, as well as the deeply satisfying nature of the work. For newcomers to the field, the book can function as a field guide. Anyone who engages in geriatric mental health services or research needs to read this book."--Sara Honn Qualls, PhD, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs &nbsp;"This important, inspiring book is destined for the 'must-read' list of students in psychology, geriatrics, social work, nursing, and other health professions who are interested in working with older people and their families. With this revised text, Zarit and Zarit have succeeded once more in providing mental health professionals with a clear and well-written reference tool for their own clinical practice. Of particular benefit to students and practicing clinicians alike are the useful and practical case examples that illustrate the key concepts presented in each chapter."--Lynn Friss Feinberg, MSW, National Center on Caregiving, Family Caregiver Alliance&nbsp;"Liberally illustrated with case examples, this book artfully blends clinical expertise and research findings to provide sound guidance and proven approaches to assessment and intervention. It is no short order to write a book that appeals to students, to experienced practitioners seeking to build their skills for working with older adults, and to researchers seeking a broad foundation in clinical concepts, but Zarit and Zarit have successfully achieved that goal. I found the chapters on assessment to be particularly well done.

Dubbed the &#x201c;Nun Study&#x201d; because it involves a unique population of 678 Catholic sisters, this remarkable long-term research project has made headlines worldwide with its provocative discoveries.<br>Yet <b>Aging with Grace</b> is more than a groundbreaking health and science book. It is the inspiring human story of these remarkable women&#x2014;ranging in age from 74 to 106&#x2014;whose dedication to serving others may help all of us live longer and healthier lives.<br><br>Totally accessible, with fascinating portraits of the nuns and the scientists who study them, <b>Aging with Grace</b> also offers a wealth of practical findings:<br><br>� Why building linguistic ability in childhood may protect against Alzheimer&#x2019;s<br>� Which ordinary foods promote longevity and healthy brain function<br>� Why preventing strokes and depression is key to avoiding Alzheimer&#x2019;s<br>� What role heredity plays, and why it&#x2019;s never too late to start an exercise program <br>� How attitude, faith, and community can add years to our lives<br><br>A prescription for hope, <b>Aging with Grace</b> shows that old age doesn&#x2019;t have to mean an inevitable slide into illness and disability; rather it can be a time of promise and productivity, intellectual and spiritual vigor&#x2014;a time of true grace.</p><p>"What distinguishes this study is Snowdon's decision not to maintain the usual "objective" distance from his subjects but rather to become emotionally involved with them. His commitment to treat them with 'care and respect' is readily apparent in the many warm and sympathetic anecdotes and his expression of deeply felt grief when any of the sisters becomes incapacitated by Alzheimer's or dies. ... [R]eaders will certainly appreciate the early insights to be gleaned from Snowdon's human- (rather than statistic-) centered and compassionate story."<br>&#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"The Nun Study represents an absolutely unique American treasure and resource for all of us.

It should excite all Americans about their nation.</p><p>Informative and entertaining, this volume is an indispensable reference work for home, library and office. It establishes a foundation for the burgeoning field of ethnic studies; it will satisfy and stimulate the popular interest in ancestry and heritage. It is a guide to the history, culture, and distinctive characteristics of the more than 100 ethnic groups who live in the United States.</p><p>Each ethnic group is described in detail. The origins, history and present situation of the familiar as well as the virtually unknown are presented succinctly and objectively. Not only the immigrants and refugees who came voluntarily but also those already in the New World when the first Europeans arrived, those whose ancestors came involuntarily as slaves, and those who became part of the American population as a result of conquest or purchase and subsequent annexation figure in these pages. The English and the Estonians, the Germans and the Gypsies, the Swedes and the Serbs are interestingly juxtaposed. Even entries about relatively well-known groups offer new material and fresh interpretations. The articles on less well-known groups are the product of intensive research in primary sources; many provide the first scholarly discussion to appear in English. One hundred and twenty American and European contributors have been involved in this effort, writing either on individual groups or on broad themes relating to many.</p><p>The group entries are at the heart of the book, but it contains, in addition, a series of thematic essays that illuminate the key facets of ethnicity. Some of these are comparative; some philosophical; some historical; others focus on current policy issues or relate ethnicity to major subjects such as education, religion, and literature. American identity and Americanization, immigration policy and experience, and prejudice and discrimination in U.S. history are discussed at length. Several essays probe the complex interplay between assimilation and pluralism&#x2015;perhaps the central theme in American history&#x2015;and the complications of race and religion.</p><p>Numerous cross-references and brief identifications will aid the reader with unfamiliar terms and alternative group names. Eighty-seven maps, especially commissioned, show where different groups have originated. Annotated bibliographies contain suggestions for further reading and research. Appendix I, on methods of estimating the size of groups, leads the reader through a maze of conflicting statistics. Appendix II reproduces, in facsimile, hard-to-locate census and immigration materials, beginning with the first published report on the nativities of the population in 1850.</p></p><p>This book isn&#39;t cheap, but it&#39;s well worth the sticker price for people seriously interested in the role of race and ethnicity in American life. Distinguished Harvard historian Stephan Thernstrom assembled an impressive collection of experts to write definitively on almost every racial and ethnic group that has had a presence in the United States. A series of extended essays on assimilation, language, law, literature, politics, and other topics also make the book essential reading. The massive numbers of new immigrants entering the United States will demand that this book receive an essential update sometime in the 21st century, but until then it remains a wonderful resource covering more than 200 years of American history.Informative and entertaining, this volume is an indispensable reference work for home, library, and office.

The 4th edition also features an expanded instructor&#39;s resource package designed to assist instructors in course planning and classroom presentation and full integration of content with Aplia, the leading online Economics education program. In the 4th edition Greg Mankiw has created a full educational program for students and instructors -- Experience Mankiw 4e. &#34;I have tried to put myself in the position of someone seeing economics for the first time. My goal is to emphasize the material that students should and do find interesting about the study of the economy.&#34; - N. Gregory Mankiw.</p><p>N. Gregory Mankiw is Robert M. Beren Professor of Economics and Chair of the Department of Economics at Harvard University. He studied economics at Princeton University and MIT. He has taught macroeconomics, microeconomics, statistics, and principles of economics. Professor Mankiw is a prolific writer and a regular participant in academic and policy debates. His research includes work on price adjustment, consumer behavior, financial markets, monetary and fiscal policy, and economic growth. His published articles have appeared in academic journals such as the AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW, JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, and QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS and in more widely accessible forums including THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, and FORTUNE. In addition to his teaching, research, and writing, Professor Mankiw has been a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, an adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Congressional Budget Office, and a member of the ETS test development committee for the advanced placement exam in economics. From 2003 to 2005, he served as chairman of the President&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers. In addition, he maintains a very popular blog for students of economics at http://www.gregmankiw.blogspot.com."The book's strengths include its ability to explain in plain language the beauty of economic theory; the concise manner in which real world examples are integrated into the text; and, the online assistance that does an effective job in complementing the text."<br><br>"I think that the greatest strengths are that it is clear (written in a student-friendly language), relatively concise, and provides a good coverage of what I think students need to know about principles of economics. I think that the style of the text is personable and is easy for students to read without being condescending. In terms of the coverage, as I noted above, we cover the entire text in my one-semester class, and cover just about exactly the entire text - no more, and only a little (two chapters) less."<br><br>"I find navigation process very simple. I am very impressed with Meet your tutor - Master the Learning Objectives section (that is so well planned out and organized). If students are having problems with any of the material and they're serious about being successful in this class, it is impossible for them not to understand the material after doing suggested activities in this section.

It includes nearly 450 illustrations. The text is the same as that of the 1974 edition. </p><p>Mythologist Joseph Campbell was a masterful storyteller, able to weave tales from every corner of the world into compelling, even spellbinding, narratives. His interest in comparative mythology began in childhood, when the young Joe Campbell was taken to see Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at Madison Square Garden. He started writing articles on Native American mythology in high school, and the parallels between age-old myths and the mythic themes in literature and dreams became a lifelong preoccupation. Campbell's best-known work is <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> (1949), which became a <i>New York Times</i> paperback best-seller for Princeton in 1988 after Campbell's star turn on the Bill Moyers television program <i>The Power of Myth</i>. </p><p> During his early years as a professor of comparative religion at Sarah Lawrence College, Campbell made the acquaintance of Indologist Heinrich Zimmer, a kindred spirit who introduced him to Paul and Mary Mellon, the founders of Bollingen Series. They chose Campbell's <i>The Mythic Image</i> as the culmination of the series, giving it the closing position--number one hundred. A lavishly illustrated and beautifully produced study of the mythology of the world's high civilizations, <i>The Mythic Image</i> received a front-cover review in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> upon publication. Through the medium of visual art, the book explores the relation of dreams to myth and demonstrates the important differences between oriental and occidental interpretations of dreams and life.</p></p><p></p><h2>The World in Depression, 1929-1939 (History of the World Economy in the Twentieth Century)</h2><p>"<i>The World in Depression</i> is the best book on the subject, and the subject, in turn, is the economically decisive decade of the century so far."--John Kenneth Galbraith</p><p><b>Charles P.

However, most clinicians find it a challenge to develop an effective, person-centered treatment plan. Such a plan is required for reimbursement, regulatory, accreditation and managed care purposes.

Jackson&#39;s investigation into some mysterious arson fires on Martha&#39;s Vineyard becomes personal when one of the fires takes the life of his old friend, African American bluesman Corrie Appleyard, who was in town to play a few shows</p><p>You can almost taste the freshly caught bluefish and smell the tangy salt air in Philip Craig's newest Martha's Vineyard mystery, a seasonal delight featuring former Boston policeman J.W. Jackson. J.W. hasn't seen legendary bluesman Corrie Appleyard since he was a child, and when Corrie arrives on the Vineyard for a rare concert appearance, J.W. couldn't be happier. It's almost enough to take his mind off the series of arson fires that have destroyed the dilapidated summer cottages that a local slumlord rents out at outrageously high prices to college kids who've come to work and play in the famous summer colony. But when Corrie's precious guitar is found at the site of the latest fire, and an unidentified body is pulled from the ruins, J.W. fears the worst.<p> Although he's already busy trying to track down a blackmailer who's been threatening Susanna Quick, his wife Zee's close friend, J.W. agrees to investigate the arson fires for the owner of the cottages, which leads him into still another unsolved mystery: why is Zee so opposed to his newest client? By the time the connection between the arsonist, the slumlord, Susanna, and Zee is unraveled in a surprising denouement, you'll have worked up an appetite. Luckily, the author has included the recipes of Vineyard favorites at the end of this tasty mystery. J.W. is an extremely appealing hero, a man of simple pleasures who's not averse to putting himself on the line to defend his wife, his family, and his close-knit community of friends and neighbors . The pacing won't keep you from a nap after a day of sun and salt water, but the book moves along nicely, the Vineyard landscape is lovingly and authentically evoked, and the characters are well drawn. <i>Vineyard Blues</i> is another satisfying outing for this accomplished writer (who also brought us <i>A Fatal Vineyard Season</i>, <i>A Shoot on Martha's Vineyard</i>, <i>Death on a Vineyard Beach</i>) and his likable protagonist. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>Philip R.

The story, told by three male narrators, revolves around a beautiful figure skating champion, Nuria Mart�. When she is suddenly dropped from the Olympic team, a pompous but besotted civil servant secretly builds a skating rink in the ruined Palacio Benvingut, using public funds. But Nuria has affairs, provokes jealousy, and the skating rink becomes a crime scene. A mysterious pair of women, an ex-opera singer and a taciturn girl often armed with a knife, turn up as well.<br><br> A complex book, <em>The Skating Rink</em>&#x2019;s short chapters are skillfully broken off with questions to maintain the narrative tension: <em>Who was murdered? Who was the murderer? Will the murderer be caught?</em> All of these questions are answered, and yet <em>The Skating Rink</em> is not fundamentally a crime novel, or not exclusively; it&#x2019;s also about political corruption, sex, the experience of immigration, and frustrated passion.

Here are the ways in which passion must accept, must insist, that "death . . . give / not only take from us." This piercing short collection treats desire in a style that is chaste, spare, figuratively modulated, and almost classical in its precision. In lyrics that ponder what happens to the bodies of lovers--so vital when together, different when apart, death coming to one before the other--Michaels embraces both the intimacy and the vastness of the connection between two people. Love's sheltering understanding is a powerful presence in all the poems, with its particular imagery (the ringing fog, the white page of the bed), as is the shattering loss of its end. With Michaels, we enter a space that is "not inside / not outside: dusk's / doorway," where memory might be kept alive.</p><p><b>ANNE MICHAELS</b> is the author of the multiple prizewinner <i>Fugitive Pieces,</i> which was made into a major motion picture, and a second novel, <i>The Winter Vault,</i> which was a finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award, and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, and a nominee for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.

Though he is still best known for this finding, his partnership with his sister Caroline yielded groundbreaking work, including techniques that remain in use today. The duo pioneered comprehensive surveys of the night sky, carefully categorizing every visible object in the void. Caroline wrote an influential catalogue of nebulae, and William discovered infrared radiation. Celebrated science writer Michael Lemonick guides readers through the depths of the solar system and into his protagonists' private lives: William developed bizarre theories about inhabitants of the sun; he procured an unheard-of salary for Caroline even while haggling with King George III over the funding for an enormous, forty-foot telescope; the siblings feuded over William's marriage and eventually reconciled. Erudite and accessible, <em>The Georgian Star</em> is a lively portrait of the pair who invented modern astronomy. 9 illustrations</p><p>A former senior science writer at Time, Michael Lemonick is the author of several books, including Echo of the Big Bang.

When William Herschel, in 1781, discovered Uranus (which he named the Georgian Star in hopes of getting much-needed funding from King George), he was a self-taught amateur astronomer earning his living as a musician. When the king offered Herschel �200 per year&#x2014;a 50% drop in income&#x2014;the astronomer gladly accepted the chance to become the king's astronomer. His goal was to discover how the universe was constructed, and Herschel, an obsessive observer, made a remarkable number of discoveries, including infrared radiation. He also taught his sister Caroline to help with his work, and soon she was publishing her own discoveries, hunting comets and cataloguing thousands of stars and nebulae. When the king agreed to give her a salary, she became the first paid woman scientist. Lemonick (<i>Echo of the Big Bang</i>) paints a vibrant and revealing picture of these two scientists whose painstaking observation and cataloguing paved the way for modern astronomy. 9 illus. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In ancient times, the warrior learned to master the challenges of life, both on and off the battlefield. He acquired a sense of personal freedom and power&#x2014;not through violence or aggression, but through gentleness, courage, and self-knowledge. The Japanese samurai, the warrior-kings of Tibet, the knights of medieval Europe, and the warriors of the Native American tribes are a few examples of this universal tradition of wisdom. <br><br>With this book the warrior's path is opened to contemporary men and women in search of self-mastery and greater fulfillment. Interpreting the warrior's journey in modern terms, Trungpa discusses such skills as synchronizing mind and body, overcoming habitual behaviors, relaxing within discipline, facing the world with openness and fearlessness, and finding the sacred dimension of everyday life. Above all, Trungpa shows that in discovering the basic goodness or human life, the warrior learns to radiate that goodness out into the world for the peace and sanity of others. <br><br>The Shambhala teachings&#x2014;named for a legendary Himalayan kingdom where prosperity and happiness reign&#x2014;thus point to the potential for enlightened conduct that exists within every human being. "The basic wisdom of Shambhala," Trungpa writes, "is that in this world, as it is, we can find a good and meaningful human life that will also serve others. That is our true richness."</p><p>code of the warrior as a way for modern men and women to meet the challenges of life with fearlessness and dignity.Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

Commissario De Luca is heading up a dangerous investigation into the private lives of the rich and powerful during the frantic final days of the facist regime. The hierarchy has guaranteed De Luca their full cooperation, just so long as he arrests the "right" suspect. The house of cards built by Mussolini in the last months of WWII is collapsing and De Luca faces a world mired in sadistic sex, dirty money, drugs and murder.</p> <p>One of Italy's best-loved crime writers, <b>Carlo Lucarelli</b> has published over a dozen novels and short story collections.</p></p><p>Carlo Lucarelli is one of Italy&#39;s best-loved crime writers. He teaches at Alessandro Baricco&#39;s Holden School in Turin and in Padova&#39;s maximum security prison. He conducts the program &#34;Blue Night&#34; on Italian network television, and his novels Almost Blue and Lupo Mannaro have both been made into films.Chaotic, fascist Italy is the tantalizing setting for the first entry in Lucarelli's (<i>Almost Blue</i>) De Luca trilogy. In the final year of WWII, while opportunism, desperation and resistance run rampant, Rehinard Vittorio, a well-connected Fascist, drug dealer and philanderer, is stabbed to death and castrated, leaving behind no dearth of suspects for the tortured insomniac, Commissario De Luca, to investigate. Was the murderer Rehinard's boss, the foreign affairs minister who's collaborating with the British, or the minister's morphine-addicted and sexually compromised daughter? How about the minister's political rival, whose wife and son are trying to buy their way into neutral Switzerland with drug profits? De Luca's a complex man who believes the police shouldn't be used as political goons, even as his investigation draws him deeper into the seedy underworld of a crumbling regime. His astutely rendered inner turmoil makes him an intriguing protagonist, but the other characters never spring to life. Lucarelli also breezes through the minutiae of Italian Fascism, which may leave American readers in the lurch, but these faults fail to overpower the trenchant grit of this excursion into Italian noir. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form."

Might invisibility be regarded not simply as refuge, but as a condition with its own meaning and power? The impulse to escape notice is not about complacent isolation or senseless conformity, but about maintaining identity, autonomy, and voice.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In our networked and image-saturated lives, the notion of disappearing has never been more alluring. Today, we are relentlessly encouraged, even conditioned, to reveal, share, and promote ourselves. The pressure to be public comes not just from our peers, but from vast and pervasive technology companies that want to profit from patterns in our behavior. A lifelong student and observer of the natural world, Busch sets out to explore her own uneasiness with this arrangement, and what she senses is a widespread desire for a less scrutinized way of life&#x2014;for invisibility. Writing in rich painterly detail about her own life, her family, and some of the world&#x2019;s most exotic and remote places, she savors the pleasures of being unseen. Discovering and dramatizing a wonderful range of ways of disappearing, from virtual reality goggles that trick the wearer into believing her body has disappeared to the way Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s Mrs. Dalloway finds a sense of affiliation with the world around her as she ages, Busch deliberates on subjects new and old with equal sensitivity and incisiveness.<br><br> <i>How to Disappear</i> is a unique and exhilarating accomplishment, overturning the dangerous modern assumption that somehow fame and visibility equate to success and happiness. Busch presents a field guide to invisibility, reacquainting us with the merits of remaining inconspicuous, and finding genuine alternatives to a life of perpetual exposure. Accessing timeless truths in order to speak to our most urgent contemporary problems, she inspires us to develop a deeper appreciation for personal privacy in a vast and intrusive world.</p><p>Akiko Busch is the author of several essay collections, including <i>Nine Ways to Cross a River</i>, a series of linked essays about swimming across American rivers and <i>The Incidental Steward</i>, published by Yale University Press in 2013 and awarded an Honorable Mention in the Natural History Literature category of 2013 National Outdoor Book Awards. She was a contributing editor at <i>Metropolis</i> magazine for twenty years, and her work has appeared in numerous national magazines, newspapers, and exhibition catalogues. She is on the faculty of the School of Visual Arts in New York City.&#x201c;Coming upon [HOW TO DISAPPEAR] was like finding the Advil bottle in the medicine cabinet after stumbling about with a headache for a long time...For [Busch], invisibility is not simply a negative, the inverse of visibility. Going unseen, undetected, overlooked: These are experiences with their own inherent &#x2018;meaning and power&#x2019;; what we need is a &#x2018;field guide&#x2019; for recognizing them. And this is what Busch offers, roaming from essay to essay in a loose, associative style, following invisibility where it takes her...Inconspicuousness can be powerful&#x2014;this may be Busch&#x2019;s most radical point, especially at a moment when we&#x2019;re conditioned to think power means yelling louder than everyone else in your Twitter feed, or showing the world in Instagram how you&#x2019;re living your best life...Silence and invisibility, [Busch insists], are part of our everyday lives&#x2014;the place our mind wanders when we&#x2019;re in the shower or out jogging, the feeling we get looking out the window of an airplane, the pleasure of becoming a stranger on a bustling city street. We take these pauses, these moments of exhalation, for granted, but we should clutch them close.

Almost everything that actually matters in life happens beneath the surface. Ms. Busch, who has rightly been compared to Annie Dillard and Edward Abbey, has dedicated nearly 30 years to sounding this message, one that our age seems intent on ignoring...It is precisely Ms. Busch&#x2019;s subtle contrarianism that deserves our sustained attention....<i>How to Disappear</i> is, at least in part, a description of how the world might reappear to us if we weren&#x2019;t so hellbent on overwhelming it...On the surface, <i>How to Disappear</i> is a palliative for the alienation that modern overexposure begets. Ms. Busch would like to save us from ourselves, from the lonely fate that afflicts Narcissus, his eyes forever locked on the only person he has ever truly loved&#x2014;himself. But in its deeper moments, the book touches on an abiding, but easily forgotten, truth: Disappearing, the act of losing our selves, is a precondition of selflessness. Ms. Busch&#x2019;s deeper concern is to save not Narcissus but rather the wider world his selfishness affects.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>John Kaag, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><i> <br><br></i>&#x201c;In <i>How to Disappear,</i> Busch contemplates how government surveillance, smart technology, and our own desire to be seen have all contributed to a perhaps irrevocable loss of personal privacy. She does this circuitously, eschewing the alarmist and Luddite tropes that encumber many studies of our technology-dependent culture. Instead, Busch meanders across a broad cultural landscape to locate the source of our beliefs, fears, and desires about invisibility.... [She] explores camouflage, anonymity and unsigned works of art, and police surveillance of minorities. By drawing from natural science, children&#x2019;s literature, folklore, art history, and more, Busch takes the timely issue of privacy and makes it timeless.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>The Paris Review</i></b><i><br></i><br> <b>&#x201c;</b>An impressive look at myriad, diverse examples of invisibility.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Library Journal&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;As the world grows ever more connected, it's imperative that voices preaching caution without hyperbole come to the fore.

What made them special was the sheer volume of fundamental change they brought to the largest industry in the history of the world. They not only re-shaped the auto business, the six made a sizable dent in the societies they lived in. To a man they were great cognitive thinkers. Their minds worked with animal speed, even instinct speed. But more than anything these were brave and cantankerous souls who rode the waves of history. Each could see the future. They could just make it out-sometimes imperfectly, but could see it nonetheless. They took a business that had begun to mature and decline by the 1930s and found ways to make it fresh and whole again.- The compelling story of the global car business over the past half-century.- A lively and engaging narrative that recounts some times collaborative, sometimes archly antagonistic interactions among the men- Full of business revelations at the highest level, written by a journalist operating at the heart of the industry- Global appeal that shows how automotive groups in the USA, Europe and Asia have influenced each other- A business story interlaced with personal details that explains why the six were determined to be successfulAbout the AuthorFor two decades, Richard Johnson has worked for Crain Communications, publisher of the world&#39;s leading automotive business publications.

Willfully stunting his growth at 3 feet, playing his tin drum and piercing scream as anarchistic weapons, he provides a profound yet hilarious perspective on both German history and the human condition in the modern world.</p><p>Meet Oskar Matzerath, "the eternal three-year-old drummer." On the morning of his third birthday, dressed in a striped pullover and patent leather shoes, and clutching his drumsticks and his new tin drum, young Oskar makes an irrevocable decision: "It was then that I declared, resolved, and determined that I would never under any circumstances be a politician, much less a grocer; that I would stop right there, remain as I was--and so I did; for many years I not only stayed the same size but clung to the same attire." Here is a Peter Pan story with a vengeance. But instead of Never-Never Land, G�nter Grass gives us Danzig, a contested city on the Polish-German border; instead of Captain Hook and his pirates, we have the Nazis. And in place of Peter himself is Oskar, a twisted <i>puer aeternis</i> with a scream that can shatter glass and a drum rather than a shadow. First published in 1959, <i>The Tin Drum</i>'s depiction of the Nazi era created a furor in Germany, for the world of Grass's making is rife with corrupt politicians and brutal grocers in brown shirts: <blockquote> There was once a grocer who closed his store one day in November, because something was doing in town; taking his son Oskar by the hand, he boarded a Number 5 streetcar and rode to the Langasser Gate, because there as in Zoppot and Langfuhr the synagogue was on fire. The synagogue had almost burned down and the firemen were looking on, taking care that the flames should not spread to other buildings. Outside the wrecked synagogue, men in uniform and others in civilian clothes piled up books, ritual objects, and strange kinds of cloth. The mound was set on fire and the grocer took advantage of the opportunity to warm his fingers and his feelings over the public blaze. </blockquote> As Oskar grows older (though not taller), portents of war transform into the thing itself. Danzig is the first casualty when, in the summer of 1939, residents turn against each other in a pitched battle between Poles and Germans. In the years that follow, Oskar goes from one picaresque adventure to the next--he joins a troupe of traveling musicians; he becomes the leader of a group of anarchists; he falls in love; he becomes a recording artist--until some time after the war, he is convicted of murder and confined to a mental hospital. <p> <i>The Tin Drum</i> uses savage comedy and a stiff dose of magical realism to capture not only the madness of war, but also the black cancer at the heart of humanity that allows such degradations to occur. Grass wields his humor like a knife--yes, he'll make you laugh, but he'll make you bleed, as well. There have been many novels written about World War II, but only a handful can truly be called great; <i>The Tin Drum</i>, without a doubt, is one. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The greatest German novel since the end of World War II, <b>The Tin Drum</b> is the autobiography of Oskar Matzerath, thirty years old, detained in a mental hospital, convicted of a murder he did not commit.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of his third birthday, Oskar had "declared, resolved, and determined [to] stop right there, remain as I was, stay the same size, cling to the same attire" (striped pullover and patent-leather shoes).&nbsp;&nbsp;That same day Oskar receives his first tin drum, and from then on it is the means of his expression, allowing him to draw forth memories from the past as well as judgments about the horrors, injustices, and eccentricities he observes through the long nightmare of the Nazi era.&nbsp;&nbsp;As that era ebbs bloodily away, as drum succeeds drum, Oskar participates in the German postwar economic miracle -- working variously in the black market, as an artist's model, in a troupe of traveling musicians.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the onset of affluence and fame, Oskar decides to grow a few inches, only to develop a humpback.&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite his newfound status (and stature), Oskar remains haunted by the deaths of his parents, afflicted by his responsibility for past sins -- and so assumes guilt for a murder he did not commit as an act of atonement and an opportunity to find consolation.The rhythms of Oskar's drums are intricate and insistent, and they lead us, often by way of shocking fantasies, through the dark forest of German history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Oskar's piercing, outspoken voice and deformed little figure, through the imaginative distortion and exaggeration of historical experience, a pathetically hilarious yet startlingly true portrayal of the human situation comes into view.</p><h2>Modern American Usage: A Guide</h2><p><p>A classic since its first edition in 1966, <i>Modern American Usage</i> has been called a book that "every literate American ought to read."

Why I didn&#x2019;t lock the damn door to begin with. Or why it didn&#x2019;t register that something was wrong&#x2014;so mercilessly wrong&#x2014;when I felt the mattress shift under his weight. Why I didn&#x2019;t scream when I opened my eyes and saw him crawling between my sheets. Or why I didn&#x2019;t try to fight him when I still stood a chance.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how long I lay there afterward, telling myself: Squeeze your eyelids shut, try, just try to forget. Try to ignore all the things that didn&#x2019;t feel right, all the things that felt like they would never feel right again. Ignore the taste in your mouth, the sticky dampness of the sheets, the fire radiating through your thighs, the nauseating pain&#x2014;this bulletlike thing that ripped through you and got lodged in your gut somehow. No, can&#x2019;t cry. Because there&#x2019;s nothing to cry about. Because it was just a dream, a bad dream&#x2014;a nightmare. Not real. Not real. Not real. That&#x2019;s what I keep thinking: NotRealNotRealNotReal. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Like a mantra. Like a prayer.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know that these images flashing through my mind&#x2014;a movie of someone else, somewhere else&#x2014;will never really go away, will never ever stop playing, will never stop haunting me. I close my eyes again, but it&#x2019;s all I can see, all I can feel, all I can hear: his skin, his arms, his legs, his hands too strong, his breath on me, muscles stretching, bones cracking, body breaking, me getting weaker, fading. These things&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all there is.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how many hours pass before I awake to the usual Sunday morning clamor&#x2014;pots and pans clanging against the stove. Food smells seeping under my door&#x2014;bacon, pancakes, Mom&#x2019;s coffee. TV sounds&#x2014;cold fronts and storm systems moving through the area by midday&#x2014;Dad&#x2019;s weather channel. Dishwasher-running sounds. Yippy yappy dog across the street yips and yaps at probably nothing, as always. And then there&#x2019;s the almost imperceptible rhythm of a basketball bouncing against the dewy blacktop and the squeaky-sneaker shuffling of feet in the driveway. Our stupid, sleepy suburbia, like every other stupid, sleepy suburbia, awakens groggy, indifferent to its own inconsequence, collectively wishing for one more Saturday and dreading chores and church and to-do lists and Monday morning. Life just goes, just happens, continuing as always. Normal. And I can&#x2019;t shake the knowledge that life will just keep on happening, regardless if I wake up or not. Obscenely normal.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know, as I force my eyes open, that the lies are already in motion. I try to swallow. But my throat&#x2019;s raw. Feels like strep, I tell myself. I must be sick, that&#x2019;s all. Must have a fever. I&#x2019;m delirious. Not thinking clearly. I touch my lips. They sting. And my tongue tastes blood. But no, it couldn&#x2019;t have been. Not real. So as I stare at the ceiling, I&#x2019;m thinking: I must have serious issues if I&#x2019;m dreaming stuff like that. Horrible stuff like that. About Kevin. Kevin. Because Kevin is my brother&#x2019;s best friend, practically my brother. My parents love him like everyone does, even me, and Kevin would never&#x2014;could never. Not possible. But then I try to move my legs to stand. They&#x2019;re so sore&#x2014;no, broken feeling. And my jaw aches like a mouthful of cavities.<br> <br>I close my eyes again. Take a deep breath. Reach down and touch my body. No underwear. I sit up too fast and my bones wail like I&#x2019;m an old person. I&#x2019;m scared to look. But there they are: my days-of-the-week underwear in a ball on the floor. They were my Tuesdays, even though it was Saturday, because, well, who would ever know anyway? That&#x2019;s what I was thinking when I put them on yesterday. And now I know, for sure, it happened. It actually happened. And this pain in the center of my body, the depths of my insides, restarts its torture as if on cue. I throw the covers off. Kneecap-shaped bruises line my arms, my hips, my thighs. And the blood&#x2014;on the sheets, the comforter, my legs.<br> <br>But this was supposed to be an ordinary Sunday.<br> <br>I was supposed to get up, get dressed, and sit down to breakfast with my family. Then after breakfast, I would promptly go to my bedroom and finish any homework I hadn&#x2019;t finished Friday night, sure to pay special attention to geometry. I would practice that new song we learned in band, call my best friend, Mara, maybe go to her house later, and do dozens of other stupid, meaningless tasks.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not what&#x2019;s going to happen today, I know, as I sit in my bed, staring at my stained skin in disbelief, my hand shaking as I press it against my mouth.<br> <br>Two knocks on my bedroom door. I jump.<br> <br>&#x201c;Edy, you up?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s voice shouts. I open my mouth, but it feels like someone poured hydrochloric acid down my throat and I might never be able to speak again. Knock, knock, knock: &#x201c;Eden, breakfast!&#x201d; I quickly pull my nightgown down as far as it will go, but there&#x2019;s blood smeared on that, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; I finally call back, my voice scratchy and horrible.<br> <br>She cracks the door open. As she peers in her eyes immediately go to the blood. &#x201c;Oh God,&#x201d; she gasps, as she slips inside and quickly shuts the door behind her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2014;&#x201d; But how am I supposed say the words, the worst words, the ones I know have to be spoken?<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Edy.&#x201d; She sighs, turning her head at me with a sad smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wh&#x2014;&#x201d; I start to say. How can it be okay, in what world is this okay?<br> <br>&#x201c;This happens sometimes when you&#x2019;re not expecting it.&#x201d; She flits around my room, tidying up, barely looking at me while she explains about periods and calendars and counting the days. &#x201c;It happens to everyone. That&#x2019;s why I told you, you need to keep track. That way you won&#x2019;t have to deal with these&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. surprises. You can be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prepared.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is what she thinks this is.<br> <br>Now, I&#x2019;ve seen enough TV movies to know you&#x2019;re supposed to tell. You&#x2019;re just supposed to fucking tell. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you hop in the shower, sweetie?&#x201d; she interrupts. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; she begins, gesturing with her arm in a wide circle over my bed, searching for the word, &#x201c;this mess.&#x201d;<br> <br>This mess. Oh God, it&#x2019;s now or never. Now or never. It&#x2019;s now. &#x201c;Mom&#x2014;&#x201d; I try again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be embarrassed,&#x201d; she says with a laugh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine, really, I promise.&#x201d; She stands over me, looking taller than she ever has before, handing me my robe, oblivious of my Tuesday underwear crumpled at her feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, Kevin&#x2014;&#x201d; I start, but his name in my mouth makes me want to throw up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Edy. He&#x2019;s out back with your brother. They&#x2019;re playing basketball. And your father&#x2019;s glued to the TV, as usual. Nobody&#x2019;ll see you. Go ahead. Put this on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Looking up at her, I feel so small. And Kevin&#x2019;s voice moves like a tornado through my mind, whispering&#x2014;his breath on my face&#x2014;No one will ever believe you. You know that. No one. Not ever.<br> <br>Then my mom shakes the robe at me, offering me a lie I didn&#x2019;t even need to think up. She starts getting that look in her eye&#x2014;that impatient, it&#x2019;s-the-holidays-and-I-don&#x2019;t-have-time-for-this look. Clearly, it was time for me to get going so she could deal with this mess. And clearly, nobody was going to hear me. Nobody was going to see me&#x2014;he knew that. He had been around long enough to know how things work here.<br> <br>I try to stand without looking like everything is broken. I kick the Tuesdays under the bed so she won&#x2019;t find them and wonder. I take my robe. Take the lie. And as I look back at my mother, watching her collect the soiled sheets in her arms&#x2014;the evidence&#x2014;I know somehow if it&#x2019;s not now, it has to be never. Because he was right, no one would ever believe me. Of course they wouldn&#x2019;t. Not ever.<br> <br><br> <br>In the bathroom, I carefully peel off my nightgown, holding it at arm&#x2019;s length as I ball it up and stuff it in the garbage can under the sink. I adjust my glasses and examine myself more closely. There are a few faint marks on my throat in the shape of his fingers. But they&#x2019;re minor, really, in comparison to the ones on my body. No bruises on my face. Only the two-inch scar above my left eye from my bike accident two summers ago. My hair is slightly more disastrous than usual, but essentially I look the same&#x2014;I can pass.<br> <br>By the time I get out of the shower&#x2014;still dirty, after scrubbing my body raw, thinking I could maybe wash the bruises off&#x2014;there he is. Sitting at my kitchen table in my dining room with my brother, my father, my mother, sipping my orange juice from my glass&#x2014;his mouth on a glass I would have to use someday. On a fork that would soon be undifferentiated from all the other forks. His fingerprints not only all over every inch of me, but all over everything: this house, my life, the world&#x2014;infected with him.<br> <br>Caelin raises his head and narrows his eyes at me as I cautiously approach the dining room. He can see it. I knew he would see it right away. If anyone was going to notice&#x2014;if I could count on anyone&#x2014;it would be my big brother. &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;re being really weird and intense right now,&#x201d; he announces. He could tell because he always knew me even better than I knew myself.<br> <br>So I stand there and wait for him to do something about this. For him to set his fork down, stand up and pull me aside, take me out to the backyard by the arm, and demand to know what&#x2019;s wrong with me, demand to know what happened. Then I&#x2019;d tell him what Kevin did to me and he&#x2019;d give me one of his big brother-isms, like, Don&#x2019;t worry, Edy, I&#x2019;ll take care of it. The way he did whenever anyone was picking on me. And then he&#x2019;d run back inside the house and stab Kevin to death with his own butter knife.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not what happens.<br> <br>What happens is he just sits there. Watching me. Then slowly his mouth contorts into one of his smirks&#x2014;our inside-joke grin&#x2014;waiting for me to reciprocate, to give him a sign, or just start laughing like maybe I&#x2019;m trying to secretly make fun of our parents. He&#x2019;s waiting to get it. But he doesn&#x2019;t get it. So he just shrugs, looks back down at his plate, and lops off a big slice of pancake. The bullet lodges itself a little deeper in my stomach as I stand there, frozen in the hallway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously, what are you staring at?&#x201d; he mumbles with his mouth full of pancake, in that familiar brotherly, you&#x2019;re-the-stupidest-person-on-the-face-of-the-earth tone he had perfected over the years.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Kevin barely even glances up. No threatening looks. No gestures of warning, nothing. As if nothing had even happened. The same cool disregard he always used with me.

The previous fourteen years had merely been dress rehearsal, preparation for knowing how to properly shut up now.

Tim Harford shows that if you want to be creative and resilient, you need a little more disorder in your world.&#x201d; &#x2014;Adam Grant, <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of <i>Originals</i> and <i>Give and Take</i></b><br><br><b><b><b><b>&#x201c;Engrossing.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></b></b></b></b><br><br>From the award-winning columnist and author of the national bestseller<i>&nbsp;The Undercover Economist </i>comes a provocative big idea book about the genuine benefits of being messy: at home, at work, in the classroom, and beyond.</b><i><br></i><br><b><b>Look out for Tim's next book,</b></b><i><b><b> <i>Fifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy.</i></b></b><br><br>Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives</i> celebrates the benefits that messiness has in our lives: why it&#x2019;s important, why we resist it, and why we should embrace it instead. Using research from neuroscience, psychology, social science, as well as captivating examples of real people doing extraordinary things, Tim Harford explains that the human qualities we value &#x2013; creativity, responsiveness, resilience &#x2013; are integral to the disorder, confusion, and disarray that produce them. <br><br> From the music studio of Brian Eno to the Lincoln Memorial with Martin Luther King, Jr., from the board room to the classroom, messiness lies at the core of how we innovate, how we achieve, how we reach each other &#x2013; in short, how we succeed.<br><br> In <i>Messy</i>, you&#x2019;ll learn about the unexpected connections between creativity and mess; understand why unexpected changes of plans, unfamiliar people, and unforeseen events can help generate new ideas and opportunities as they make you anxious and angry; and come to appreciate that the human inclination for tidiness &#x2013; in our personal and professional lives, online, even in children&#x2019;s play &#x2013; can mask deep and debilitating fragility that keep us from innovation. <br><br> Stimulating and readable as it points exciting ways forward, <i>Messy</i> is an insightful exploration of the real advantages of mess in our lives.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2016:</strong> For those who think that a spick-and-span desk is an indication of high productivity, Harford's fascinating investigation of how disorder can spark innovation will open your eyes to all kinds of situations when tidiness is not a virtue. From Brian Eno's fury-provoking Oblique Strategy cards that wrung a new sound from already talented musicians to how mixing differently talented teams can help them find solutions and keep their eye on the goal, <em>Messy</em> bolsters the theory that disorder creates heightened alertness. That alertness, in turn, fuels creativity, problem solving, better driving, resilience, innovation, and much more. But if the only thing you get out of <em>Messy</em> is peace with the level of disorder at your coworkers', staff's, or spouse's workspace, then that alone is priceless. <em>--Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Tim Harford</b>&nbsp;is an award-winning journalist, economist and broadcaster.

In the next scenario, she survives&nbsp; adolescence and moves to Russia with her husband. Both are dedicated Communists, but our heroine is sent to a labor camp.

But behind the brilliant creator of such lasting works as La Boh�me, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, La Fanciulla del West, La Rondine, and Turandot, there was a person racked with indecision, self-doubt, bouts of depression, and private misfortunes.In this beautifully written work, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz brings to life both the man and his circle. Setting Puccini&#39;s intriguing story within the worlds of his beloved Tuscany and the cutthroat opera business, the author follows the composer from boyhood in his ancestral Lucca, to his struggling student years at the Milan Conservatory, to his early successes and failures, to the artistic triumphs that earned him international celebrity and considerable wealth.Filled with colorful details and anecdotes drawn from extensive primary sources as well as interviews with descendents, family friends, and colleagues, the book chronicles Puccini&#39;s personal sorrows and scandals, and recounts his stormy professional rivalries and associations in England, Europe, and the United States. Phillips-Matz also skillfully untangles the threads of the gifted artist&#39;s complex and contradictory character. She reveals a sophisticated composer who often drew upon exotic thematic material and an elegant cosmopolite who loved his several villas, expensive cars, boats, and fine clothes. Yet Puccini remained passionately wedded to the simple life of the Tuscan countryside of his youth.</p><p>Mary Jane Phillips-Matz is the author of Rosa Ponselle: American Diva, also published by Northeastern University Press, and the highly praised Verdi: A Biography, which won the Royal Philharmonic Prize, the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award, and the New York Governor&#39;s Award of Excellence. She served as manager of the Spoleto Festival for several years, and is a regular contributor to Opera News. She lives in New York City. William Weaver is Professor of Literature at Bard College. He is a music critic, author of several books on nineteenth-century Italian opera, and translator of many contemporary Italian writers of fiction. He won the National Book Award for his translation of Italo Calvino&#39;s Cosmicomics.The literature on Puccini continues to grow with these two books. Italian-born Budden (The Operas of Verdi) here synthesizes Puccini's musical endeavors with his life. Using a straightforward, chronological approach, giving exact dates when possible, he treats each opera in a separate chapter, devoting much space to character and plot and citing contemporary reviews and subsequent reception. He also mentions Puccini's other instrumental and vocal compositions. Informed lay readers will gain insight while theoreticians will appreciate Budden's deeper musical analysis. His elegant turns of phrase ("rhythmic scaffolding") and obvious expertise combine in an exceptional whole, though a few Britishisms may confuse American readers. A list of works, useful biographical information on personalities mentioned in the text, and a strong bibliography round out the volume. Michele Girardi's recently translated Puccini: His International Art is similar, with even more specific treatment of musical passages. Highly recommended for academic and music collections, as well as sophisticated clients at public libraries. Phillips-Matz (Verdi: A Biography) discusses Puccini as if she were telling the life story of a valued friend. She remarks on premieres, casts, and critical reception of the works but says little about the music itself. However, she does expand upon the personal issues touched on by Budden (e.g., the Doria Manfredi incident). She also sets a cultural context with historical descriptions of the Tuscan region and extensive information on Puccini's forebears. Her style is stimulating and, for the most part, more entertaining than merely informative. In a rather old-fashioned way, she talks about her own meetings with characters like Puccini's granddaughter, Biki, and singer Gilda Dalla Rizza. Her method of including "footnotes" within the text and abbreviations is helpful; however, one wishes that she had indicated in the introduction the groupings of relevant materials rather than repeating them each time they occurred. She also includes a works list, six major contemporary opera composers and their works, and an up-to-date bibliography. Conrad Wilson's Giacomo Puccini in Phaidon Press's "20th-Century Composers" series makes a good complement, although Phillips-Matz's approach is more genteel and positive. Recommended for all collections. (Indexes and illustrations not seen in either.) Barry Zaslow, Miami Univ.

Decades later, it still stands up to scrutiny, explicating not only Eastern philosophies but also how modern physics forces us into conceptions that have remarkable parallels. Covering over 3,000 years of widely divergent traditions across Asia, Capra can't help but blur lines in his generalizations. But the big picture is enough to see the value in them of experiential knowledge, the limits of objectivity, the absence of foundational matter, the interrelation of all things and events, and the fact that process is primary, not things. Capra finds the same notions in modern physics. Those approaching Eastern thought from a background of Western science will find reliable introductions here to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism and learn how commonalities among these systems of thought can offer a sort of philosophical underpinning for modern science. And those approaching modern physics from a background in Eastern mysticism will find precise yet comprehensible descriptions of a Western science that may reinvigorate a hope in the positive potential of scientific knowledge. Whatever your background, <i>The Tao of Physics</i> is a brilliant essay on the meeting of East and West, and on the invaluable possibilities that such a union promises. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Fritjof Capra has done research in theoretical high-energy physics at the University of Paris; the University of California; Stanford University; and Imperial College, London. He holds a PhD from the University of Vienna. Dr. Capra is the author of five international best sellers: <i>The Tao of Physics</i> (1975), <i>The Turning Point </i>(1982), <i>Uncommon Wisdom</i> (1988), <i>The Web of Life</i> (1996), and <i>The Hidden Connections</i> (2002).</p><h2>Joyce Chen Cook Book (English and Traditional Chinese Edition)</h2><p>Joyce Chen (1917 - 1994) was a Chinese chef, restaurateur, author, television personality, and entrepreneur. Joyce Chen was credited with popularizing northern-style Chinese cuisine in the United States, coining the name "Peking Raviolis" for potstickers, inventing and holding the patent to the flat bottom wok with handle (also known as a stir fry pan), and developing the first line of bottled Chinese stir fry sauces for the US market. Starting in 1958, she operated several popular Chinese restaurants in Cambridge, MA. Joyce Chen died of Alzheimer's disease in 1994; since then, her accomplishments and influence on American cuisine have been honored by the US Postal Service and the City of Cambridge. In this book, exquisite, subtle, different recipes are included, but it provides much more than that. It explains how to select meats and vegetables; how to buy and how to prepare. Here you will discover the correct way to make Chinese tea, prepare rice, use chopsticks, and learn about the three great regional schools of cooking within China: Cantonese, Mandarin, Szechuan. All of the hows and whys and whereas are in this book. Mrs. Chen carefully explains and demonstrates with illustrations when necessary, all the process of food preparation the Chinese way. Her recipes are simple, clear and flexible enough so that the cook can find substitutes for ingredients that may be hard to procure. All the recipes in this book can be prepared successfully anywhere in the country by a reasonably adequate cook in a reasonably adequate kitchen. Mrs. Chen believes you will discover that there is less effort and greater reward cooking the Chinese way. As the world-famous heart specialist, Dr. Paul Dudley White, points out in his foreword; "Joyce Chen's recipes are commendable for several reasons. In the first place, they are a delight to the gourmet; secondly, they represent real Chinese cooking at its best; and thirdly, they are good for the health&gt;"</p><p></p><h2>The Age of Decadence: Britain 1880 to 1914</h2><p>&#39;A riveting account of the pre-First World War years . . . The Age of Decadence is an enormously impressive and enjoyable read.&#39; Dominic Sandbrook, Sunday Times &#39;A magnificent account of a less than magnificent epoch.&#39; Jonathan Meades, Literary Review The folk-memory of Britain in the years before the Great War is of a powerful, contented, orderly and thriving country. She commanded a vast empire. She bestrode international commerce. Her citizens were living longer, profiting from civil liberties their grandparents only dreamt of, and enjoying an expanding range of comforts and pastimes. The mood of pride and self-confidence is familiar from Elgar&#39;s Pomp and Circumstance marches, newsreels of George V&#39;s coronation and the London&#39;s great Edwardian palaces. Yet things were very different below the surface. In The Age of Decadence Simon Heffer exposes the contradictions of late-Victorian and Edwardian Britain. He explains how, despite the nation&#39;s massive power, a mismanaged war against the Boers in South Africa created profound doubts about her imperial destiny. He shows how attempts to secure vital social reforms prompted the twentieth century&#39;s gravest constitutional crisis and coincided with the worst industrial unrest in British history. He describes how politicians who conceded the vote to millions more men disregarded women so utterly that female suffragists&#39; public protest bordered on terrorism. He depicts a ruling class that fell prey to degeneracy and scandal. He analyses a national psyche that embraced the motor-car, the sensationalist press and the science fiction of H. G. Wells, but also the Arts and Crafts of William Morris and the nostalgia of A. E. Housman. And he concludes with the crisis that in the summer of 1914 threatened the existence of the United Kingdom - a looming civil war in Ireland. He lights up the era through vivid pen-portraits of the great men and women of the day - including Gladstone, Parnell, Asquith and Churchill, but also Mrs Pank</p><p></p><h2>The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs: Recrowning Baseball&#39;s Greatest Slugger</h2><p>In an unprecedented look at Babe Ruth&#39;s amazing batting power, sure to inspire debate among baseball fans of every stripe, one of the country&#39;s most respected and trusted baseball historians reveals the amazing conclusions of more than twenty years of research. Jenkinson takes readers through Ruth&#39;s 1921 season, in which his pattern of battled balls would have accounted for more than 100 home runs in today&#39;s ballparks and under today&#39;s rules. Yet, 1921 is just tip of the iceberg, for Jenkinson&#39;s research reveals that during an era of mammoth field dimensions Ruth hit more 450-plus-feet shots than anybody in history, and the conclusions one can draw are mind boggling.</p><p>Bill Jenkinson has served as consultant for The Baseball Hall of Fame, Major League Baseball, The Society for American Baseball Research, The Babe Ruth Museum, and ESPN. He has been quoted in nearly every major American newspaper as well as <i>Time, Newsweek,</i> and <i>Sports Illustrated,</i> and has written several pieces for <i>Sports Weekly.</i> He has also written articles for various Major League teams. He is the acknowledged expert on the history of long distance home runs and one of the country's top Ruth scholoars. Each year, he assists descendents of men who claimed to have played against the Babe in unofficial games. They seek confirmation for their loved ones' cherished memory of sharing a ball field with Babe Ruth. Jenkinson lives in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.In this exhaustively researched examination of Babe Ruth's storied career, Jenkinson argues that the Bambino was the greatest slugger of all time, not Barry Bonds, not Sammy Sosa, not Hank Aaron, and not Roger Maris. To make his point, he approaches Ruth from three perspectives. First, he discusses and analyzes Ruth's historic batting power, relying on original newspaper accounts. Second, he examines Ruth's "hidden" career of about 800 exhibition games. Third, he does a degree-of-difficulty analysis between the various conditions (equipment, medical sophistication, and press scrutiny, among other factors) Ruth experienced and those of sluggers in other eras. For example, Ruth injured a knee early in his career, and it was a recurring problem. It would have been easily repaired with modern medicine. Current conventional sports wisdom holds modern athletes are bigger, faster, stronger, and therefore better. Here we have the carefully researched, imaginatively argued contrary position. Great reading for any baseball fan, but especially those whose passions are ignited by comparisons of players from different eras. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This lavish volume, studded with graphics and nuggets of information, is the pleasing result. <i>Science Fiction : The Illustrated Encyclopedia</i> showcases the prophecy and pageantry of science fiction. It weaves together world history with literary history and technical developments with SF trends, providing a cultural context to the Zeitgeist of the genre. Words truly cannot do justice to the visual delights of this colorful tome: time lines, charts, author biographies and bibliographies complete with photos and signatures, illustrated analyses of SF traditions, magazine covers, classic book covers, film and television snapshots, and historical photos. Use it as a reference, read it through, or pick it up and enjoy it in bits. <i>Science Fiction : The Illustrated Encyclopedia</i> will arouse curiosity, joy, and pride in the hearts of SF lovers. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i>Clute, coauthor of the award-winning <i>Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i> [<i>RBB</i> N 1 93], has compiled a beautifully illustrated work on the same subject. Not alphabetically arranged, the book is divided into chapters that cover themes in science fiction, history, magazines, major authors, classic titles, graphic works, film, and television. It concludes with a glossary of terms and an index with page numbers in boldface type for main entries.<p>The intelligent use of illustrations in this work truly demonstrates the old maxim that a picture is worth a thousand words. Clute is very clever in selecting just the right images to illustrate his theme. For example, in the section titled "The 1900s: The Future of the City" are juxtaposed drawings of future cities as seen by H. G. Wells and Winsor McCay with views of New York City in ruins from John Ames Mitchell's <i>The Last American</i>. Clute includes photographs or sketches of authors, stills from movies and TV programs, and covers of magazines and books to show the depth and range of science fiction literature. He also makes effective use of chronology to show both the history of science fiction and contemporary world events that affected the writers. A brilliant illustration of this technique is the section on the years 1940^-49, which recounts World War II with Pearl Harbor, atomic weapons, paper shortages, and such publications as <i>The Gremlins</i> and such movies as <i>The Purple Monster Strikes</i> and <i>Superman</i>.</p><p>The section on authors is one of the book's greatest strengths.

Following the accidental bulldozing of a tomb during the building of a housing complex in suburban Jerusalem in 1980, archaeologists from the Israeli Antiquities Authority were immediately called to the scene. Inside, the archaeologists found ten ossuaries&#x2014;limestone boxes that served as first-century coffins. Six had inscriptions, including Jesus, son of Joseph; two Marys; and Judah, son of Jesus. The team concluded that the unusual group of names was merely coincidence. After removing and cataloging the ossuaries, they left the tomb to the builders to finish what they had already started.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, Simcha Jacobovici, an Emmy award-winning journalist, tracked down the ossuaries in the Israeli Antiquities Authority's warehouse and decided to investigate this remarkable collection of names. Simcha mapped and then located the original tomb, which, to his surprise, was still intact. Granted unequaled access, he soon found that the archaeologists were unaware of key evidence that made this the discovery of a lifetime.</p><p>This is a story that is destined to grab international headlines and raise fundamental questions about the historical Jesus. Are the "Jesus" and "Mary" referred to in these inscriptions the Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the gospels? Readers are taken on a remarkable journey: from telling statistical analysis, to a time-bending trip across two millennia, and an investigation of the patinas and DNA of the tombs that makes an episode of <em>CSI</em> look mundane. <em>The Jesus Family Tomb</em> arrives at an extraordinary answer to an ancient mystery.</p><p>A riveting combination of history, archaeo-logy, and theology, this book will change the way we think about God, religion, and everything we have learned about the life and death of Jesus.</p></p><p><p>Simcha Jacobovici is an Emmy-winning documentary director and producer and a widely published writer and lecturer.

But as recent news stories prove, this imperative is routinely violated. In <i>Who Really Matters</i>, Art Kleiner argues that the dissonance between a declared mission and actual operation can be seen at organizations large and small. All organizations have one motive in common. Every decision&#x2014;which projects to back, who to promote, or how to spend money&#x2014;is affected by the perceived wants and needs of a core group of people &#x201c;who really matter.&#x201d; <br><br>The composition of the group can differ from organization to organization. Often, the most senior people in the hierarchy are members&#x2014;but not always. Sometimes, the people who &#x201c;matter&#x201d; can extend far down the corporate ladder, or even reach outside the company to include key customers, labor union leaders, and stockholders. Kleiner gives readers clues about how to identify a core group&#x2019;s real mission by observing its day-to-day actions, listening to the fundamental message it sends employees, examining its management of new members; understanding the ideas that shape its policies about management, money, and the way the world works; and avoiding the taboos governing the way it operates.<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re a member of the Core Group&#x2014;or want to be&#x2014;this deft, engaging blend of argument and observation, anecdotes and advice, is the one guide you&#x2019;ll need to achieve your career goals and aspirations by navigating the hidden pathways in any organization, large or small.</p><p><p>&#x201c;Art Kleiner has uncovered a central truth about the way organizations work. His concept of the Core Group clarifies one key reason why rational people often act in seemingly irrational ways within the confines of an institution.

His wife, Norma, has run off with her ex-husband, taking Ray&#39;s cards, shotgun and car. But from the receipts, Ray can track where they&#39;ve gone. He takes off after them, as does an irritatingly tenacious bail bondsman, both following the romantic couple&#39;s spending as far as Mexico. There Ray meets Dr Reo Symes, the seemingly down-on-his-luck and rather eccentric owner of a beaten up and broken down bus, who needs a ride to Belize. The further they drive, in a car held together by coat-hangers and excesses of oil, the wilder their journey gets. But they&#39;re not going to give up easily.</p><p>Charles Portis may be the sneakiest comedian in American letters, not to mention one of the funniest. And there's no better specimen of his double-edged art than <i>The Dog of the South</i>, which Overlook Press has recently rescued from a long, cruel, out-of-print limbo. As usual, the narrator is a down-at-the-heels Southerner with an eye for the homely detail and a mission to accomplish. What Ray Midge means to do is track down his significant other: "My wife Norma had run off with Guy Dupree and I was waiting around for the credit card billings to come in so I could see where they had gone." In another author's hands, this opening sentence might lead straight to a bloody, <i>noir</i>-ish denouement. Here it's merely the excuse for a meandering, semi-pointless quest, during which the fussbudget protagonist is assailed by tropical storms, grifters, hippies, car trouble, and even an assortment of airborne trash: "I had to keep the Buick speed below what I took to be about sixty because at that point the wind came up through the floor hole in such a way that the Heath wrappers were suspended behind my head in a noisy brown vortex."<p> Hapless, rhetorically challenged Ray Midge would more than fulfill any novel's quota for comic creation. But Portis pairs him with another indelible nutter, Dr. Reo Symes. A font of dubious financial schemes, Symes attaches himself to Ray like a peevish, passive-aggressive Pancho Sanza, and his non-sequitur-studded riffs must be heard to be believed: </p><blockquote> I always tried to help Leon and you see the thanks I got. I hired him to drive for me right after his rat died. He was with the Murrell Brothers Shows at that time, exhibiting a fifty-pound rat from the sewers of Paris, France. Of course it didn't really weigh fifty pounds and it wasn't your true rat and it wasn't from Paris, France, either. It was some kind of animal from South America. Anyway, the thing died and I hired Leon to drive for me. I was selling birthstone rings and vibrating jowl straps from door to door and he would let me out at one end of the block and wait on me at the other end. </blockquote> The vibrating jowl straps are the kicker here, of course. But it's the overall futility of the enterprise that gives Symes his comic potency, and makes him Ray's natural companion in arms. Neither of these guys is going to accomplish <i>anything</i>: they're Beckett clowns in Sansabelt trousers, too enervated by the heat even to agonize. Still, you won't find a more delicious (or less reliable) narrator in contemporary fiction, and Charles Portis's genius for inventing all-American eccentrics is anything but futile. <i>--James Marcus</i>Charles Portis lives in Arkansas, where he was born and educated.

Over the next five decades, U.S. imperialists justified their colonial empire by crafting novel racial ideologies adapted to new realities of collaboration and anticolonial resistance. In this pathbreaking, transnational study, Paul A. Kramer reveals how racial politics served U.S. empire, and how empire-building in turn transformed ideas of race and nation in both the United States and the Philippines.<br><br>Kramer argues that Philippine-American colonial history was characterized by struggles over sovereignty and recognition. In the wake of a racial-exterminist war, U.S. colonialists, in dialogue with Filipino elites, divided the Philippine population into "civilized" Christians and "savage" animists and Muslims. The former were subjected to a calibrated colonialism that gradually extended them self-government as they demonstrated their "capacities." The latter were governed first by Americans, then by Christian Filipinos who had proven themselves worthy of shouldering the "white man's burden." Ultimately, however, this racial vision of imperial nation-building collided with U.S. nativist efforts to insulate the United States from its colonies, even at the cost of Philippine independence. Kramer provides an innovative account of the global transformations of race and the centrality of empire to twentieth-century U.S. and Philippine histories.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Blood of Government</i> does valuable work in laying out the intricacies of racial (re)formations in the service of and against colonialism. . . . This book has much to offer those interested in Phillipine-American relations as well as postcolonial studies, and, surprisingly, given its length, leaves one wishing for more."-- <i>Journal of American History</i> <br>Examining racial politics during American colonial rule in the Philippines, Kramer shows that Americans did not merely export their own racial politics on a blank slate; rather, they dispensed power on the basis of race, but often faced contentious dialogue about it with Filipino elites. He argues that in order to understand Philippine-American colonialism, it is important to consider the Spanish period of colonization that preceded it.</p><h2>The Christmas Thief: A Novel</h2><p>Lottery winner-turned-amateur sleuth Alvirah Meehan joins forces with private detective Regan Reilly to track down the ninety-foot tree, destined for display in Rockefeller Center, that vanished en route to the city, unaware that the tree contains a secret cache of priceless gems, hidden by scam artist Packey Noonan before being sent to prison.

Packy was overflowing with love for his fellow man. He had been a guest of the United States Government for twelve years, four months, and two days. But because he had served over 85 percent of his sentence and been a model prisoner, the parole board had reluctantly granted Packy his freedom as of November 12, which was only two weeks away.<br><br>Packy, whose full name was Patrick Coogan Noonan, was a world-class scam artist whose offense had been to cheat trusting investors out of nearly $100 million in the seemingly legitimate company he had founded. When the house of cards collapsed, after deducting the money he had spent on homes, cars, jewelry, bribes, and shady ladies, most of the rest, nearly $80 million, could not be accounted for.<br><br>In the years of his incarceration, Packy&#x2019;s story never changed. He insisted that his two missing associates had run off with the rest of the money and that, like his victims, he, too, had been the victim of his own trusting nature.<br><br>Fifty years old, narrow-faced, with a hawklike nose, close-set eyes, thinning brown hair, and a smile that inspired trust, Packy had stoically endured his years of confinement. He knew that when the day of deliverance came, his nest egg of $80 million would sufficiently compensate him for his discomfort.<br><br>He was ready to assume a new identity once he picked up his loot; a private plane would whisk him to Brazil, and a skillful plastic surgeon there had already been engaged to rearrange the sharp features that might have served as the blueprint for the working of his brain.<br><br>All the arrangements had been made by his missing associates, who were now residing in Brazil and had been living on $10 million of the missing funds. The remaining fortune Packy had managed to hide before he was arrested, which was why he knew he could count on the continued cooperation of his cronies.<br><br>The long-standing plan was that upon his release Packy would go to the halfway house in New York, as required by the terms of his parole, dutifully follow regulations for about a day, then shake off anyone following him, meet his partners in crime, and drive to Stowe, Vermont. There they were to have rented a farmhouse, a flatbed trailer, a barn to hide it in, and whatever equipment it took to cut down a very large tree.<br><br>&#x201c;Why Vermont?&#x201d; Giuseppe Como, better known as Jo-Jo, wanted to know. &#x201c;You told us you hid the loot in New Jersey. Were you lying to us, Packy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would I lie to you?&#x201d; Packy had asked, wounded. &#x201c;Maybe I don&#x2019;t want you talking in your sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>Jo-Jo and Benny, forty-two-year-old fraternal twins, had been in on the scam from the beginning, but both humbly acknowledged that neither one of them had the fertile mind needed to concoct grandiose schemes. They recognized their roles as foot soldiers of Packy and willingly accepted the droppings from his table since, after all, they were lucrative droppings.<br><br>&#x201c;O Christmas tree, my Christmas tree,&#x201d; Packy whispered to himself as he contemplated finding the special branch of one particular tree in Vermont and retrieving the flask of priceless diamonds that had been nestling there for over thirteen years.</p><h2>The Fat Black Woman&#39;s Poems (Virago Poets)</h2><p>Grace Nichols gives us images that stare us straight in the eye, images of joy, challenge, accusation.

When he arrives, he meets Alexis Zorba, a middle-aged Greek with a zest for life. As their relationship develops, the Englishman is persuaded to change his outlook on life</p><p>Nikos Kazantzakis was born in Crete in 1883. He studied literature and art in Germany and Italy, philosophy under Henri Bergson in Paris and received his law degree from the University of Athens. The Greek Minster of Education in 1945, Kazantzakis was also a dramatist, translator, poet, and travel writer. Among his most famous works are, <i>The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel, The Last Temptation of Christ,</i> and <i>Saviors of God</i>.&nbsp; He died in October 1957.Zorba the Greek PROLOGUE<p></p> <br><br> <br>I often wished to write &#x201c;The Saint&#x2019;s Life of Alexis Zorba,&#x201d; a laborer of advanced age whom I exceedingly loved.<br> <br>The great benefactors in my life have been journeys and dreams. Very few people, dead or alive, have helped me in my struggles; yet if I wished to single out those individuals who did engrave their traces most deeply upon my soul, I would presumably designate these four: Homer, Bergson, Nietzsche, and Zorba.<br> <br>The first was a serene, all-bright eye for me like the sun&#x2019;s disk, illuminating everything with redemptive brightness. Bergson released me from insoluble philosophical anguishes that had tormented my early youth. Nietzsche enriched me with new anguishes and showed me how to transform misfortune, sorrow, and uncertainty into pride. Zorba taught me to love life and not to fear death.<br> <br>If today I were to choose a spiritual guide from the whole wide world&#x2014;a &#x201c;guru,&#x201d; as they say in India, a &#x201c;venerable father&#x201d; as the monks say at Mount Athos&#x2014;the one I would choose without fail would be Zorba. He possessed precisely what a pen pusher needs for deliverance: the primitive glance that snatches nourishment lovingly from on high; the creative artlessness, renewed at each daybreak, that views everything unceasingly as though for the first time, bequeathing virginity to the everlastingly quotidian elements of wind, sea, fire, women, and bread; the sureness of hand, the freshness of heart, the gallant stalwart&#x2019;s ability to poke fun at his own soul for seeming to harbor a power higher than the soul; finally, that wild, throaty laugh welling up from a source deeper than a man&#x2019;s inner depths, a laugh that erupted redemptively at crucial moments from Zorba&#x2019;s elderly chest, exploding with sufficient power to demolish (and did demolish) all the barricades&#x2014;morality, religion, nationalism&#x2014;erected around themselves by wretched, lily-livered humans to let them hobble securely through their diminished mini-lives.<br> <br>I can hardly endure my rage and sorrow when I consider what nourishment my famished soul was fed by books and teachers for so many years, and then compare this to the leonine brainpower that Zorba fed me for just a few months. My life was fated to be ruined because I encountered this &#x201c;venerable father&#x201d; too late, when the portion of my inner self still capable of being saved was minimal. The great alteration&#x2014;the definitive change of front, the &#x201c;conflagration&#x201d; and &#x201c;renewal&#x201d;&#x2014;did not take place. The time was already too late. Thus Zorba, instead of becoming an exalted, authoritative model for my life, was sadly debased into a literary subject causing me to fill numerous sheets of paper with splotches!<br> <br>The doleful privilege of turning life into art leads many flesh-eating souls to disaster because ardent passion departs the breast when it finds an outlet of this sort. In such a case the soul experiences relief. It no longer fumes with rage, no longer needs to fight breast to breast, to intervene directly in life or action. Instead, it is pleased to admire its ardent passion as it ascends like smoke rings in the breeze and fades away. The soul not only takes pleasure in this relief; it also grows proud, for it believes that it is accomplishing something grand by supposedly eternalizing the irreplaceable temporary moment, which alone possesses flesh and blood in limitless time. This is how Zorba, so full of flesh and bone, degenerated in my hands into paper and ink. Years ago, the Zorba story, without my wishing it to do so, and, indeed, wishing the opposite, began to crystallize within me. The mystic rites began deep inside me, a musical turbulence at first, a feverish delight and malaise, as though my organism, a foreign body having entered the bloodstream, were struggling to control and annihilate this story through assimilation. Words then began to speed around the nucleus, to encircle and nourish it like an embryo. Blurry memories became clear, sunken joys and sorrows rose to the surface, life was transposed into finer air&#x2014;and Zorba became a tall tale.<br> <br>I still lacked a clear notion of what form to give this tall Zorbatic tale: novel, poem, complex make-believe narrative from the Thousand and One Nights, or something matter-of-fact, dry, reproducing the conversations we had on the Cretan shoreline where we lived and were supposedly digging to find lignite. Both of us well knew that this practical purpose was just a smokescreen for the eyes of outside observers. Neither of us could wait for the sun to set, the workmen to leave, the two of us to stretch out on the sand, eat our delicious village food, drink our dry Cretan wine, and begin to talk.<br> <br>Most of the time I said nothing. What could an intellectual say to an ogre? I would listen to him speak about his village near Mount Olympus, about snow, wolves, terrorists during the Balkan Wars, Hagia Sophia, lignite, magnesite, women, God, patriotism, death. Then, suddenly, when he was choking and no longer able to find room for words, he would leap up onto the beach&#x2019;s rough shingle and start to dance.<br> <br>An old man, erect and bony, his head thrown back, his fully round eyes as tiny as a bird&#x2019;s, he would dance and shriek, stamping his callused soles on the shoreline, his face spattered with seawater.<br> <br>If I had listened to his voice&#x2014;not his voice, his outcry&#x2014;my life would have become worthwhile. I would have experienced with blood, flesh, and bone what I now ponder like a hashish smoker and effectuate with paper and ink.<br> <br>But I did not dare. I would see Zorba dancing at midnight with horse-like whinnies, bellowing at me to slip out of my comfortable shell of prudent habit and to flee with him on great journeys. But I remained motionless, shuddering.<br> <br>Many times in my life I have been ashamed because I caught my soul not daring to do what supreme folly&#x2014;life&#x2019;s essence&#x2014;was calling me to do. But never did I feel so ashamed of my soul as I did when in the presence of Zorba.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>One morning we parted at daybreak. I headed abroad once again, suffering from the incurable Faustian disease of learning. He went north and settled near Skopia, in Serbia, where he apparently unearthed a rich vein of magnesite in a mountainside. He hooked a few investors, purchased tools, recruited workmen, and began once again to open up galleries in the earth. He dynamited boulders, constructed roads, brought water, built a house, and married&#x2014;the lusty old codger!&#x2014;married Lyuba, a frisky, good-looking widow, fathering a child with her.<br> <br>One day when I was in Berlin I received a telegram: &#x201c;FOUND MOST BEAUTIFUL GREEN STONE. COME IMMEDIATELY. ZORBA.&#x201d;<br> <br>Germany was then suffering from intense famine. The Papiermark had fallen so low that you carried sackfuls with millions in them to make a small purchase, and when you went to a restaurant to eat you opened your napkin, which was overfilled with paper currency, and emptied it onto the table in order to pay. The day came when ten billion Papiermarks were required for a postage stamp.<br> <br>Hunger, cold, frayed jackets, tattered shoe soles, red German cheeks turned yellow. An autumn wind blew, and people fell in the streets like leaves. Infants were given a bit of rubber to gnaw as a ruse so they wouldn&#x2019;t cry. Police patrolled the bridges over the river to prevent mothers from jumping in at night to save themselves by drowning.<br> <br>It was winter, snowing. A German professor of Chinese in the room next to mine, in order to keep warm, clasped his long brush and attempted to copy some ancient Chinese poem or a Confucian maxim using the incommodious method of the Far East, by which the tip of the brush, the scholar&#x2019;s delicately elevated elbow, and his heart were required to form a triangle. &#x201c;After a few moments,&#x201d; he used to tell me with pleasure, &#x201c;sweat runs from my armpits and thus I feel warm.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was during those bitter-cold days that I received Zorba&#x2019;s telegram. At first I was annoyed. Millions of people were humiliated and forced to their knees because they lacked a slice of bread to support their spirits and bones, and here comes a telegram telling me to travel a thousand miles to go see a beautiful green stone! &#x201c;Curses on beauty!&#x201d; I said to myself. &#x201c;It is heartless, unable to sympathize with human suffering.&#x201d; But suddenly I was frightened. My annoyance had already dissipated. I felt with horror that Zorba&#x2019;s inhumane outcry was answering another inhumane outcry within myself. A savage vulture in me spread its wings, ready for departure.<br> <br>But I did not depart. Once again, I did not dare. I did not board a train, did not obey the divinely ferocious internal outcry, did not perform a gallant, irrational deed. Following the sensible, frigid, human voice of reason, I took up my pen, wrote to Zorba, and explained.<br> <br>He answered me: &#x201c;Forgive me for saying this, Boss, but you are a pen pusher. You poor creep, you had the chance of a lifetime to see a beautiful green stone, and you didn&#x2019;t see it. By God, sometimes when I have no work to do, I sit down and ask myself, &#x2018;Is there a hell or isn&#x2019;t there?&#x2019; But yesterday, when I received your letter, I said to myself, &#x2018;There sure is a hell for certain pen pushers!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Memories have begun to flow. They are jostling each other, hurrying. The time has come to put things in order, to start &#x201c;The Saint&#x2019;s Life of Alexis Zorba&#x201d; from the beginning. Even the most insignificant events related to him gleam clearly, preciously, in my mind at this moment, darting swiftly like multicolored fish in summer&#x2019;s diaphanous seawater. Nothing of his has been lost to me; everything Zorba touched seems to have become immortal. Yet these days I am suddenly worried. It has been two years since I received a letter from him. He is more than seventy years old; he may be in danger. Yes, he most certainly must be in danger; otherwise I cannot explain why I am governed by an abrupt need to reassemble whatever was his: to remember what he said to me and what he did, immobilizing everything on paper to prevent its disappearance&#x2014;as though I wished to exorcise death, his death. I fear that what I am writing is not a book; it is a memorial.<br> <br>Looking at it now, I realize that it contains all the characteristics of a memorial. The tray with its boiled wheat, the kollyva, is embellished with a thick sprinkling of sugar and the name &#x201c;ALEXIS ZORBA&#x201d; written on top with cinnamon and almonds. I look at this name and all at once the indigo-blue sea of Crete rises up, flooding my mind. Words, laughter, dancing, carousing, concerns, muted conversations at twilight, full, round eyes focused upon me forever with tender disdain as though welcoming me at every moment and also bidding me farewell at every moment.<br> <br>Just as, when we view a decorated memorial tray, disparate memories hang like bunched-up bats in the cave of our heart, so Zorba&#x2019;s ghost, without my desiring this, was complicated from the very start by another much-loved shade, Stassinakis, and behind it unexpectedly by still another, that of a fallen woman, Madame Hortense, kissed a thousand times, her hair dyed a thousand times, whom Zorba and I had met on a sandy Cretan beach by the Libyan Sea.<br> <br>The human heart must surely be a grave that is closed and filled with blood. If it opens, all the inconsolable specters that continually multiply around us, darkening the air, run to it in order to drink, quench their thirst, and return to life. They run to drink our heart blood, knowing that no other resurrection exists.<br> <br>In front of all the rest of them today runs Zorba with gigantic strides, pushing aside the other specters because he knows that the memorial taking place on this day is his own.<br> <br>Let us therefore grant him our blood so that he may be revived.<br> <br>Let us do our best to allow this amazing guzzler, swiller, workhorse, womanizer, and scalawag to remain alive just a little longer&#x2014;the broadest soul, surest body,<br> <br>freest outcry that I ever knew.</p><h2>Goodbye to All That</h2><p>Robert Graves&#39; superb autobiography tells the story of his life at public school and as a young officer during the First World War. &#39;It is a permanently valuable work of literary art, and indispensable for the historian either of the First World War or of modern English poetry ...Apart, however, from its exceptional value as a war document, this book has also the interest of being one of the most candid self-portraits of a poet, warts and all, ever painted. The sketches of friends of Mr Graves, like T.E. Lawrence, are beautifully vivid&#39; - &#34;Times Literary Supplement&#34;.</p><p><p>Account of life in the trenches from the author of <i>I, Claudius, </i>and read by Martin Jarvis</p>Born in 1895, Robert Graves went straight from school to the First World War, where he became a captain. A poet at heart, he also wrote several historical novels which include I, Claudius and Claudius the God - GOODBYE TO ALL THAT was written in 1929 and rapidly established itself as a modern classic. He translated Apuleius, Lucan and Suetonius for the Penguin Classics, and complied The Greek Myths. He was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford in 1961. He died at his home in Majorca in 1929.</p><h2>The Good German: A Novel</h2><p>Set in Berlin just after the end of World War II, a brilliant thriller about the end of one war and the beginning of another, by the bestselling author of <i>Los Alamos</i>.<br><br>Berlin, 1945. Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has managed to wangle one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the American occupation of postwar Berlin. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles on a murder--an American soldier washed up on the shore of the conference grounds--he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What he finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation and a city not only physically but morally devastatated, where children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and the black market is the only means of survival.<br><br>Berlin at zero hour is like nowhere else--a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. And nothing is simple--not the murder of a soldier and not any of the lives, American and German, that Jake encounters as he tries to solve it. More unsolvable still is the larger crime that hangs over everything in 1945, a crime so huge it seems beyond punishment. <br><br>At once a murder mystery, a love story, and a riveting portrait of a unique time and place, <i>The Good German</i> is a historical thriller of the first rank.<br></p><p>This compelling thriller is both a touching love story and a masterful portrayal of the struggle for geopolitical control of postwar Germany. Network correspondent Jake Geismar, who covered Berlin before the war, has returned to the devastated city, ostensibly to cover the Potsdam Conference but actually to find the woman he loves. Miraculously, Lena Brandt, Jake's wartime mistress, has survived. However, her mathematician husband is missing, and both the American and Russian intelligence services are hunting him. When the bullet-ridden body of an American soldier washes up on the shores of Potsdam in front of Jake's eyes just as Truman, Churchill, and Stalin convene the first postwar conference, Jake is plunged into a maelstrom of intrigue, corruption, and betrayal.<p> A brilliantly evoked portrait of a unique moment in history (the end of one war and the beginning of another), <i>The Good German</i> amply fulfills the promise shown by Joseph Kanon in his two earlier novels, <i>Los Alamos</i> and <i>The Prodigal Spy</i>. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>The bestselling author of <i>Los Alamos</i> and <i>Alibi </i>returns to 1945. Hitler has been defeated, and Berlin is divided into zones of occupation. Jake Geismar, an American correspondent who spent time in the city before the war, has returned to write about the Allied triumph while pursuing a more personal quest: his search for Lena, the married woman he left behind. When an American soldier's body is found in the Russian zone during the Potsdam Conference, Jake stumbles on the lead to a murder mystery. <i>The Good German</i> is a story of espionage and love, an extraordinary re-creation of a city devastated by war, and a thriller that asks the most profound ethical questions in its exploration of the nature of justice, and what we mean by good and evil in times of peace and of war.<br>&nbsp;<br>"[Joseph Kanon] is fast approaching the complexity and relevance not just of le Carr�&nbsp;and Greene but even of Orwell: provocative, fully realized fiction that explores, as only fiction can, the reality of history as it is lived by individual men and women."<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"The kind of book that reads so easily that it's almost impossible to put down once you've started it."<br><i>--The </i><i>Baltimore</i><i> Sun</i><br><br>"Kanon is as ambitious a novelist as he is a gifted one."<br><i>--The </i><i>Washington</i><i> Post</i><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Roots of American Foreign Policy: An Analysis of Power and Purpose.</h2><p>In &#34;The Roots of American Foreign Policy,&#34; Gabriel Kolka, one of America&#39;s most perceptive young historians, makes clear that our foreign policy is the result of neither omission nor ignorance but rather of civilian authority and civilian-defined goals. An original and captivating book with a striking epilogue on reason and radicalism.</p><p></p><h2>The Carriage Clock: A Repair and Restoration Manual</h2><p>This truly comprehensive and practical new work is the first book to be devoted solely to the repair and restoration of the carriage clock, and as such will be greatly welcomed by professional and amateur alike.&nbsp;It describes the variety of movements found in the clocks that were produced by the thousand in France. The details of the simple timepiece, strikers, alarms, quarter repeaters, and grande sonnerie are shown and discussed here. Over 220 detailed and accurate drawings display the operation of the more complex parts and the text describes symptoms, faults, and corrections of each type of movement in turn, with other chapters on tools, major repair techniques, cleaning, maintenance, and a list of suppliers of materials.</p><p>Laurie Penman has been working as a clock repairer/restorer for over thirty years. He began writing for Clocks Magazine in the 1970s, later becoming a regular contributor and columnist. He began teaching clock repairing in 1980 and, at the same time, started a correspondence course. His first book (written with a co-author) was published by Clocks Magazine as a &#39;special&#39;. Clock Design and Construction was published in the early 1980s and other books followed. Laurie Penman accepted the offer of a post at the American Watchmakers/Clockmakers&#39; Institute in Harrison, Ohio, in 2002 as a lecturer and instructor.</p><h2>A Short History of the Printed Word</h2><p>Discusses the technical innovations which have furthered the evolution of printing from the first alphabet to contemporary presses</p><p></p><h2>The Doomed City (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p><b><i>The magnum opus of Russia&#x2019;s greatest science fiction novelists translated into English for the first time</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky are widely considered the greatest of Russian science fiction masters, and their most famous work,&nbsp;<i>Roadside Picnic</i>, has enjoyed great popularity worldwide. Yet the novel they worked hardest on, that was their own favorite, and that readers worldwide have acclaimed as their magnum opus, has never before been published in English.&nbsp;<i>The Doomed City</i>&nbsp;was so politically risky that the Strugatsky brothers kept its existence a complete secret even from their closest friends for sixteen years after its completion in 1972. It was only published in Russia during perestroika in the late 1980s, the last of their works to see publication. It was translated into a host of European languages, and now appears in English in a major new effort by acclaimed translator Andrew Bromfield.<br><br><i>The Doomed City</i>&nbsp;is set in an experimental city whose sun gets switched on in the morning and switched off at night, bordered by an abyss on one side and an impossibly high wall on the other. Its inhabitants are people who were plucked from twentieth-century history at various times and places and left to govern themselves, advised by Mentors whose purpose seems inscrutable. Andrei Voronin, a young astronomer plucked from Leningrad in the 1950s, is a die-hard believer in the Experiment, even though his first job in the city is as a garbage collector. And as increasinbly nightmarish scenarios begin to affect the city, he rises through the political hierarchy, with devastating effect. Boris Strugatsky wrote that the task of writing&nbsp;<i>The Doomed City</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;was genuinely delightful and fascinating work.&#x201d; Readers will doubtless say the same of the experience of reading it.</p><p><b>Arkady</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Boris</b>&nbsp;<b>Strugatsky</b>&nbsp;were famous and popular Russian writers of science fiction, with more than twenty-five novels and novellas to their names, including&nbsp;<i>The Doomed City</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Inhabited Island</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Roadside Picnic</i>. Their books have been widely translated and made into a number of films.&nbsp;<b>Andrew Bromfield</b> has translated into English works by Victor Pelevin, Boris Akunin, Sergei Lukyanenko, Mikhail Bulgakov, Daniil Kharms, Leo Tolstoy, and the Strugatsky brothers.&nbsp;<b>Dmitry Glukhovsky</b> is the author of <i>Metro 2033</i>. He lives in Moscow."This publication of&nbsp;<i>The Doomed City</i>&nbsp;reveals the Strugatsky's great lost masterwork, an allegorical nightmare metropolis fit for the special atlas that gives home to Kafka's <i>Castle</i>, &nbsp;Charles Finney's <i>The Unholy City</i>, Rex Warner's <i>Aerodrome</i>, and a very select handful of others." -- Jonathan Lethem<br></p><h2>Emotional Agility</h2><p>Emotional Agility</p><p>Susan David has a PhD in psychology and a post-doctorate in emotions research from Yale.

The 14th Edition of Introduction to Logic, written by Copi, Cohen &amp; McMahon, is dedicated to the many thousands of students and their teachers - at hundreds of universities in the United States and around the world - who have used its fundamental methods and techniques of correct reasoning in their everyday lives.</p><p>Copi and Cohen&#39;s Introduction to Logic, Ninth Edition, is by far the most complete treatment of introductory logic, both deductive and inductive, both classical and modern. It is the standard text in logic today--the paradigm of clarity and accuracy. This text enables all students to understand, recognize, and apply classical syllogistic logic and the more powerful techniques of modern symbolic logic. Lively argumentative excerpts from politics, philosophy, science, and contemporary controversies bring substance and life to the study of logic--demonstrating the application of logical principles by serious writers and thinkers trying to solve real problems. Arguments excerpted as illustrations and as exercise material include examples of fallacies to show students how arguments go wrong when logical principles are ignored or misapplied. A few examples of argumentative reasoning were constructed for the book to demonstrate principles; however, it is the wealth of current, up-to-date examples selected from actual texts representing many fields of interest that set this book apart.<p> Many changes will be found in this new edition of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> but instructors who have used previous editions may be assured that the integrity and spirit of this book have been retained. Much of the detail of previous editions and most of the exercises also have been retained. The changes introduced&#x2014;of five different kinds&#x2014;are designed to make this well-tested volume more accessible, and thus more effective as an instrument in the teaching of elementary logic. We recount these changes briefly here, addressing this report mainly to those acquainted with previous editions. </p> <p><b><i>A Revised Chapter 1.</i></b></p> <p> Structural changes have been made in the first part of the book. The expansion of the opening chapters in the preceding edition was found by many users to hinder student progress along what may be called "the main line" of instruction in logic. We have therefore compressed the material of what was Part One into a single opening chapter in which the same topics are addressed, but more crisply, and in ways likely to provide a better base for the more advanced material in the later chapters of the book. Chapter 1 has now become very hefty as a result&#x2014;but it is also richer, more clearly formulated, and more fun to read. </p> <p><b><i>Exposition-Rules and Definitions.</i></b></p> <p> The most pervasive of the changes in this edition, and most important too, we think, are the very many adjustments in the ways in which theoretical matters are explained and expressed. We have long prided ourselves on the logical accuracy of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> and of course we would do nothing to injure our hard-earned reputation for reliability. But our colleagues around the country have advised us, on many occasions, that our efforts to be exact, and to cut no corners, have in some parts of the book resulted in formulations rather difficult to digest&#x2014;especially for beginning students. </p> <p> This is not an easy matter to address. We have worked hard to ameliorate this problem&#x2014;and if we have succeeded in this edition many of the resultant changes will be hardly noticeable. Explanations should be formulated in language that is transparent and thoroughly perspicuous, and (we hope) that will cause few brows to wrinkle. </p> <p> Some illustrations of the kind of changes we have made are worth noting. Several of our colleagues observed that, where a set of rules or criteria have been put forward (as, for example, those to test the validity of categorical syllogisms, or to appraise the merit of analogical arguments), our exposition relied too heavily, in referring to a rule, upon the number assigned to it rather than to the substance of the rule itself. We have reformulated such exposition, consistently referring now to the rule itself. </p> <p> Another example of reformulation will be noted in the chapter on definition. Previously, in explaining methods of defining, we caused needless confusion by using that much misunderstood word "connotation." The terms "connotation" and "denotation" were not employed erroneously, but to avoid confusion, we now rely fully upon the terms "intension" and "extension" in explaining techniques of definition. </p> <p> Even format can serve to confuse, or to clarify. It was and remains our practice, in presenting deductive exercises in symbols, to mark the conclusion of an argument with the three triangular dots (.-.) that commonly represent "therefore." But in earlier editions we had sometimes placed this sign on the same line as the last premise of the argument, after a slash; and sometimes we had placed this sign on a separate line of its own. This proved to be a source of distraction if not confusion, so we now consistently place the three-dot "therefore" sign of conclusion on a separate line. This format enables students to see more sharply the claim that the argument is making, and what the target of a needed proof must be. </p> <p> Many such adjustments appear in this edition, far too many to permit their identification in this Preface. In some cases the change is no more than the clarification of a transition, in others the tightening of a paragraph in which the prose was blurred. A textbook in logic ought to be concise, but it must also be precise; precision and clarity we have prized above all. </p> <p> Along with such adjustments we have sought, where feasible, to strike a lighter and more friendly tone in this edition, to introduce illustrations or observations that may amuse as they instruct. The study of logic is sometimes laborious, but it need not be forbidding. </p> <p><b><i>Sidebars.</i></b></p> <p> Those who study logic with the help of this book differ very greatly in the range of their interests and in the degree of their preparation. We will not be satisfied if we fail to challenge those who are most well prepared and most acute; but those coming to systematic logic for the first time also deserve support and guidance appropriate for them. To this end, we have introduced a device that is wholly new to <i>Introduction to Logic:</i> We have sought to distinguish some portions in some chapters that may, for good reasons, be omitted in some learning contexts, or may be treated by instructors as tangential to "the main line." These portions can serve to challenge some students who feel ready for additional work. </p> <p> Finding a way to do this without injury to the whole is problematic. We have adopted the simple device of a sidebar. These sidebars take two forms, "Advanced Material" and "For Enrichment." We emphasize that this contrivance is not meant to depreciate the passages so marked off, which are often especially interesting and demanding. But such sidebar material, we hope, will make it easier for instructors to guide their own students to a mastery of the elements of theory most critical for them&#x2014;and perhaps to avoid some complexities not essential for their solid grasp of elementary logic. Many instructors will simply ignore these markings, and may do so without damage to the understanding of their students. </p> <p><b><i>Technical Changes.</i></b></p> <p> Some technical changes have been introduced into this edition of <i>Introduction to Logic</i>&#x2014;changes that we think reduce ambiguity and thus support instruction. </p> <p> For example, we have responded to the frequently expressed concern of colleagues by expanding the discussion of logical equivalence in Chapter 8, now more sharply emphasizing the differences between material equivalence as a truth-functional connective, and logical equivalence as a logical relation that justifies the rules of replacement. An entirely new section on this topic (section 8.6) has been inserted, and in this section we have introduced a new symbol for logical equivalence as well. </p> <p> In earlier editions we allowed the equivalences expressed by the rules of replacement&#x2014;the last 10 of the 19 Rules of Inference&#x2014;to be symbolized by the same three-bar symbol with which material equivalence ("if and only if") is symbolized throughout. This practice had some justification, but it surely led to student confusion when, for example, rules of replacement were formulated in which the three-bar symbol appeared more than once, with more than one meaning. A distinct symbol was needed. </p> <p> Selecting that symbol has been a matter of long-continuing deliberation. Many alternatives were considered and rejected for reasons pedagogical or theoretical or aesthetic. We have chosen to retain the three-bar symbol, <i>over</i> which a small T indicates that the equivalence confronted is a tautology. This achieves the teaching aim, we think, with a minimum of disruption. Students are rarely called upon to write the symbol for logical equivalence&#x2014;but can (with this notation) recognize it unambiguously when it appears in the list of he rules of replacement that natural deduction employs. </p> <p> Elsewhere in the treatment of deduction, we have changed the design of Venn diagrams in representing Categorical Syllogisms. Where previously we had used simple shading to mark off what the premises of the argument rule out, we have in this edition used slanted lines. This permits the impact of each of the two premises of a syllogism to be distinguished, and because their lines are slanted in opposite directions, a cross-hatching results when the logical impacts of the two premises overlap. Different colors we chose not to use, not wanting to convey the suggestion that students would need anything more than an ordinary pencil to employ Venn diagrams for themselves. </p> <p><b><i>Revised Exercises.</i></b></p> <p> Finally, exercise sets provided at the close of many sections have been enriched. Many exercises have been added, some removed. As in previous editions of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> we have sought to provide a wide array of illustrative passages, where possible on controversial issues likely to be of genuine interest to college students. Some contrived exercises are still used, or course, but we take pride in the fact that the exercises are for the most part extracted from worthy books and periodicals of very great variety. We have not excluded the writing of classical, and even ancient philosophers&#x2014;but we greatly favor arguments and illustrations produced in the push and pull of discourse in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. </p> <p> As in the past, we have scrupulously avoided partisanship in selecting these materials. When some passage provides a telling example of some mistake in reasoning, or a fine illustration of some argumentative technique, we have included it whatever our judgment of its conclusion might be. What we wrote in the Preface to the preceding edition we again affirm: The argumentative chips must be allowed to fall where they may. </p> <p> Finally, we draw attention to the substantial influence of criticisms and suggestions received from colleagues, senior and junior&#x2014;whose names and institutions are noted elsewhere in these pages. We strive to make <i>Introduction to Logic</i> a teaching instrument ever more finely tuned, and the responses of readers around the world have given us splendid help in spotting errors and identifying deficiencies. We earnestly welcome this thoughtful engagement-and for this continuing and widespread support we express here, not for the first or the last time, our heartfelt appreciation. </p></p><h2>Come to Grief</h2><p>Convinced that one of his closest friends, a renowned racer, is behind a series of violent acts, Sid Halley faces the most troubling case of his career and becomes the target of backlashing fans and media representatives.

The rules, policies, and institutions that have guided the world since World War II have largely run their course. Respect for sovereignty alone cannot uphold order in an age defined by global challenges from terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons to climate change and cyberspace. Meanwhile, great power rivalry is returning. Weak states pose problems just as confounding as strong ones. The United States remains the world&#x2019;s strongest country, but American foreign policy has at times made matters worse, both by what the U.S. has done and by what it has failed to do. The Middle East is in chaos, Asia is threatened by China&#x2019;s rise and a reckless North Korea, and Europe, for decades the world&#x2019;s most stable region, is now anything but. As Richard Haass explains, the election of Donald Trump and the unexpected vote for &#x201c;Brexit&#x201d; signals that many in modern democracies reject important aspects of globalization, including borders open to trade and immigrants.<br><br> In <i>A World in Disarray</i>, Haass argues for an updated global operating system&#x2014;call it world order 2.0&#x2014;that reflects the reality that power is widely distributed and that borders count for less. One critical element of this adjustment will be adopting a new approach to sovereignty, one that embraces its obligations and responsibilities as well as its rights and protections. Haass also details how the U.S. should act towards China and Russia, as well as in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. He suggests, too, what the country should do to address its dysfunctional politics, mounting debt, and the lack of agreement on the nature of its relationship with the world.<br><br><i> A World in Disarray</i> is a wise examination, one rich in history, of the current world, along with how we got here and what needs doing. Haass shows that the world cannot have stability or prosperity without the United States, but that the United States cannot be a force for global stability and prosperity without its politicians and citizens reaching a new understanding.</p><p><b>Dr. Richard Haass</b>&nbsp;is president of the non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations.

But it is better, and in fact necessary, to take a step back, first to understand how we arrived where we are and, second, to discern what about this world is genuinely new and different.<br><br>The best place to begin is with the concept of world order. For many reasons, the concept, from its modern inception nearly four centuries ago to the present, is central to this book. &#x201c;Order&#x201d; is one of those terms that is used a great deal, but like a lot of popular terms, it is used differently by different people and can obscure as much as illuminate. It is best used and understood in a neutral, descriptive way, as a reflection of the nature of international relations at any moment. It is a measure of the world&#x2019;s condition. It includes and reflects arrangements that promote peace and prosperity and freedom as well as developments that do not. In short, &#x201c;order&#x201d; is not the same as &#x201c;orderly&#x201d;; to the contrary, the term &#x201c;order&#x201d; implicitly also reflects the degree of disorder that inevitably exists. One can have world orders that are anything but stable or desirable.<br><br>The term is experiencing something of a revival. <i>World Order</i> is, among other things, the title of a recent book by Henry Kissinger.1 Kissinger, the preeminent foreign policy practitioner of the second half of the twentieth century, is also one of the most influential writers not just on this subject but on many aspects of diplomatic history and international relations. And for these and related reasons I will come back to him more than once in the course of this book. I want to begin, though, with another academic, an Australian, Hedley Bull.<br><br>I came to know Hedley when I was a graduate student at Oxford in the mid-1970s. We became friends, and his thinking and writing came to have a major influence on me. Bull wrote in 1977 what I find to be the most important contemporary book in the field of international relations, <i>The Anarchical Society</i>. Its subtitle, appropriately enough, is <i>A Study of Order in World Politics</i>.2<br><br>Bull writes about international <i>systems</i> and international <i>society</i>. It is a distinction with a difference. An international system is simply what exists at the international level absent any policy decisions, in that countries and other entities along with various forces interact with and affect one another. There is little or nothing in the way of choice or regulation or principles or rules. An international society, by contrast, is something both different from and very much more than a system. What distinguishes a system from a society is that the latter reflects a degree of buy-in on the part of participants, including an acceptance on their part of limits on either what is sought or discouraged, how it is to be sought or discouraged, or both. It is rules-based. These rules (or limits) are accepted by the members of the society for the simple reason that they determine it is their best (or least bad) course of �action given the choices that are realistically available. Such rules as there are can be enshrined in formal legal �agreements or honored tacitly and informally.<br><br>In the international sphere, the notion of &#x201c;society&#x201d; as described by Bull has specific meaning. First, the principal &#x201c;citizens&#x201d; of this society are states, a word used interchangeably here and elsewhere in these and other pages with both &#x201c;nation-states&#x201d; and &#x201c;countries.&#x201d; Second, a founding principle of this society is that states and the governments and leaders who oversee them are essentially free to act as they wish within their own borders. How those individuals come to �occupy positions of authority, be it by birth, revolution, elections, or some other way, matters not. Third, the members of this international society respect and accept not just this freedom of action on the part of others (in exchange for others in turn accepting that they can act as they wish within their own borders) but also the existence of other members of this society. States therefore seek to avoid war among themselves. It is not far off to describe this approach to international relations as being something of a &#x201c;live and let live&#x201d; cross-border understanding.<br><br>But history is always more than just the narrative of consensus; it is also at least as much a narrative of disagreement and friction. The mix of success and failure, of order and �disorder, is central to the work of Bull. As suggested by the title of his book, history at any moment or in any era is the result of the interaction between forces of society and anarchy, of order and disorder. It is the balance between the two, between society and anarchy, that determines the dominant character of any era.<br><br>This is a useful framing concept for approaching and understanding the world. At any moment, it provides a snapshot of where things are. And if enough snapshots are saved and strung together from days or months or years before, it provides a moving picture of trends.<br><br>Before going any further, it is essential to make clear just what is required for there to be order. Here I want to return to&nbsp;Henry Kissinger and to an early book of his, <i>A World Restored</i>.3 The book was published some sixty years ago and based upon Kissinger&#x2019;s doctoral dissertation, something that should probably give every graduate student more than a little pause. Replete with vivid character portraits, it is a wonderfully written book, one that darts back and forth between �specific history and larger lessons. Kissinger writes about the building of a new international order, about a world that was in large part resurrected in the aftermath of revolution and the Napoleonic&nbsp;Wars in the late eighteenth and early �nineteenth centuries. It is the history of an international, that is,&nbsp;European order that was recognized at the Congress of �Vienna&#x2014;a gathering in 1814 and 1815 where, among others, the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, Prussia, Russia, and Austria-Hungary met to shape Europe&#x2019;s future&#x2014;and that survived for much of the nineteenth century.<br><br>The Congress of Vienna is noteworthy as an early example of an effort to promote peace and stability. The final product included any number of territorial arrangements, land swaps, recognitions of rightful rulers, and more. It is also noteworthy for what it did not do. While it did help bolster Europe&#x2019;s peace for several decades, it ultimately came undone amid the emergence of revolutionary movements in or near several of the participants, a changing balance of power that reflected both Prussia&#x2019;s (and later Germany&#x2019;s) rise and the fading and ultimate disappearance of multiple empires. This is worth highlighting as it is a reminder of how orders can come to an end and in so doing become disorders.<br><br>It is useful to deconstruct the concept of order, to break it down into its most essential elements. One critical element of order is the concept of &#x201c;legitimacy,&#x201d; defined by Kissinger to mean &#x201c;international agreement about the nature of workable arrangements and about the permissible aims and methods of foreign policy.&#x201d;4 Used in this fashion, legitimacy is a big idea, as it not just defines the rules of international relations&#x2014;what is to be sought and how, as well as how these rules are to be set and modified&#x2014;but also reflects the extent of their acceptance by actors with real power.<br><br>But just as essential to this notion of order, just as essential as this concept of legitimacy, was something much less intellectual. Here again I quote: &#x201c;No order is safe without physical safeguards against aggression.&#x201d;5 Thus Kissinger, writing sixty years ago about a very different world, made clear that order depended both on there being rules and arrangements to govern international relations and on a balance of power.<br><br>Bull and Kissinger have a good deal in common. Both were mostly concerned with order between states, especially the major powers of a particular era. Order reflects the degree to which those with substantial power accept existing arrangements or rules for conducting international relations, as well as the diplomatic mechanisms for setting and modifying those rules. It also reflects the ability of those same powers to meet the challenges of others who do not share their perspective. Disorder, as explained by both Bull and Kissinger, reflects the ability of those who are dissatisfied with existing arrangements to change them, including through the use of violence. This emphasis is hardly surprising. After all, great-power rivalry, great-power competition, and great-power conflict constitute much of what we think of as history. This was certainly the case for the twentieth century, which was defined by two world wars and a third that mercifully remained largely cold.<br><br>Order can be understood in this way, reflecting efforts by states to discourage the use of military force to achieve foreign policy aims. Tied to this view is that order is a respect for&nbsp;sovereignty, defined as allowing fellow states (and the gov�ernments and leaders in charge of them) to do much as they please within their borders. This approximates what is best understood as the classical view of order. The premise of this approach is that the principal objective of the foreign policy of any government ought to be influencing the foreign policy of other governments rather than the nature of the society over which they preside. As will be discussed later, this definition of order is not universally shared; to the contrary, it is too much for those who do not accept existing borders and not enough for those who worry most about what takes place within borders wherever they may be drawn.<br><br>The classical notion of order described above is normally attributed to the Treaty of Westphalia, the pact signed in 1648 that ended the Thirty Years War, a part-religious, part-political struggle within and across borders that raged across much of Europe for three decades. The treaty was something of a breakthrough, in that disorder and conflict born of frequent interference inside the borders of one&#x2019;s neighbors had been the norm. The Westphalian order is based on a balance of power involving independent states that do not interfere in one another&#x2019;s &#x201c;internal business.&#x201d;<br><br>The historian Peter Wilson, who wrote one of the finest books on the Thirty Years War, put it this way: &#x201c;Westphalia&#x2019;s significance lies not in the number of conflicts it tried to resolve, but in the methods and ideals it applied&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sovereign states interacting (formally) as equals within a common secularized legal framework regardless of size, power or internal configuration.&#x201d;6<br><br>All this constituted a significant change in how the world operated. Secular sovereign states had become preeminent; empires founded on religious identity no longer dominated. Size or power didn&#x2019;t necessarily matter the most, as states (all being sovereign entities) had equal rights in principle if not in practice. This approach to order may seem terribly narrow through the lens of the second decade of the twenty-first century, and in many ways it is. But in its time, in its day, in the first half of the seventeenth century, this was an enormous breakthrough. Until then, there was little order in the world other than that imposed by the strongest entity. War was a frequent occurrence between and among this or that principality or state or empire. The idea of trying to bring about a world in which there was not, to use modern parlance, nonstop intervention in the internal affairs of others was a major advance. And it helped set the stage for a considerable period of relative stability in Europe.<br><br>As noted, the Congress of Vienna in the second decade of the nineteenth century was convened to come up with a post-Napoleonic diplomatic settlement.7 The leaders of the day were so traumatized by what had just taken place that they operationalized the concepts of the Westphalian model, resulting in the Concert of Europe. The concert, as the word suggests, was an orchestration of how international relations in Europe would be conducted given the mind-set of those involved at the time, about how they would accept current borders and for the most part leave one another alone within their territories.8 It encompassed frequent high-level diplomatic consultation among representatives of the major powers. In the words of one historian, the concert &#x201c;had a deeply conservative sense of mission. Based on respect for kings and hierarchy, it prioritized order over equality, stability over justice.&#x201d;9 It was hardly the only time in history when a great shock&#x2014;in this case, revolution in France and the fear it might spread&#x2014;changed collective behavior. And that is what happened. And for all the problems of the nineteenth century, it compares well in many ways with the century that followed.<br><br>Indeed, it was not until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that we witnessed wholesale breakdown of the Concert of Europe, and with it the Westphalian order. (The midcentury Crimean War between Russia and both Great Britain and France was a struggle more about who was to control territory of the fading Ottoman Empire than about anything fundamental.) What occurred were two dramatic developments. First, there arose new nation-states (most&nbsp;prominently Prussia, the forerunner of Germany) unwilling to �accept the territorial and political status quo that had developed. They rejected the legitimacy of existing international arrangements. And they were strong enough to act. The balance of power no longer precluded action or deterred them from �acting. This last point suggests the second development that so shaped the history of this period. Many of the entities that had dominated the world for centuries were failing and in some cases literally falling apart. This was true of Austria-�Hungary, Russia (soon to be ravaged by revolution), and the Ottoman Empire. The United States was only decades out of its&nbsp;civil war and was focused on continental expansion and �industrialization. Europe seemed a long way off. All these changes gathered momentum in the second half of the nineteenth century and reached their climax when in the early part of the twentieth century the world experienced the grim effects of a wholesale breakdown of order.<br><br>Some of this history can be explained by the limits of the&nbsp;ability of orders to endure in the absence of great diplomatic&nbsp;dexterity. The Congress of Vienna, which led to the post-�Napoleonic settlement and subsequently to the Concert of Europe, succeeded in no small part because it involved individuals of rare diplomatic skill. For this reason Castlereagh, Metternich, and Talleyrand, respectively the ministers of Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, and France, remain significant historical figures.<br><br>An optimist would take a moment here to point out the power of human agency, the quality of diplomats, to affect the course of events. This was and remains true. One reason why the Concert of Europe got off the ground and lasted for as long as it did was the ability of some of the people involved in its creation....</p><h2>Costume Jewellery</h2><p>Diamantes are set to become a girl&#39;s best friend with this collector&#39;s guide to costume jewellery.

All these tales take place in fantastic, eerie landscapes and are narrated in surreal, stylized voices. Carrington (House of Fear , etc.) creates not characters and situations, but abstract concepts, which often result in stories that lack warmth and the power to engage. The effect is intellectually impressive but emotionally unsatisfying. In the pieces that do come to life, though, the abstract merges with reality in a chillingly mesmerizing blend. In "White Rabbits," after a first visit to her mysterious, leprous neighbors in New York, the narrator concludes her frightful tale: "I stumbled and ran, choking with horror; some unholy curiosity made me look over my shoulder . . . and I saw her waving . . . and as she waved . . . her fingers fell off and dropped to the ground like shooting stars." The novella "The Stone Door" is the highlight of the volume. The magically unfolding fable tells of Zacharias, a 20th century Hungarian Jew who is destined to voyage beyond the boundaries of time to the shores of ancient Mesopotamia, and open the great stone door of the mountain Kescke to release his true love. This modern fairy tale burns with the passion and purpose that is often missing in the shorter, intellectualized works.

In Cooper's version, Donallan falls in love with one of three beautiful naked selkie-maidens that he sees sitting on the rocks. Stealing her sealskin so that she cannot return to the sea, he marries her. Although she bears his five children, whom she loves deeply, she longs for her home and her family in the sea. At last she learns where her skin is hidden and, putting it on, dives joyously into the waves. But every year, Donallan and his children go down to the sea and when they return, there is "a look on their faces like sunlight." Cooper retells this ancient folktale from the coastal regions of Ireland and Scotland in a simple, direct storybook style, which, while lacking some of the exquisite beauty and flowing language of an Eva LaGalliene, still captures enough of the essence to appeal to young readers. Hutton's watercolors match and extend Cooper's narrative in the best traditional "picture story book" fashion, and if both fall slightly short of the haunting and timeless quality possible in such a tale, they still create a story to capture and hold the young. Yet Gerstein's book, grounded in familial love, is the more appealing version. Constance A. Mellon, Department of Library &amp; Information Studies, East Carolina University , Greenville, N.C.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The illustrious author and artist have created a haunting version of the Scottish folktale about the selkie. Newbery Medalist Cooper tells the story of a man who falls in love with a woman; she becomes a seal as she swims away. A year later, he steals her sealskin so she cannot leave and makes her his bride. The tale focuses on the longing of the selkie, Mairi, a "wild creature" who goes "back to the wild, in the end." When Mairi accidentally finds out where her husband hid her sealskin, she tells her children she must leave them because she also has children in the sea. Her daughter understands, saying, "You must go to them. It's their turn." The lyrical text weaves a tale of sweeping dimension; this is storytelling at its finest. Particularly lovely are Hutton's sensitive and muted watercolors, which successfully capture the mood evoked by the book's opening and closing sentence: "The islands rise green out of the sea, where the waves roam over the grey rocks, and strange things may happen there." <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>China Moon Cookbook</h2><p><p><b>Winner of an IACP/Julia Child Cookbook Award</b><br><br> The "Julia Child of Chinese cooking" (San Francisco Chronicle), Barbara Tropp was a gifted teacher and the chef/owner of one of San Francisco's most popular restaurants.

She lives in Santa Cruz, California.CHAPTER ONE<br><br><i>in which we gather<br>at Jocelyn's<br>to discuss</i> Emma<p>&nbsp;</p><p>We sat in a circle on Jocelyn's screened porch at dusk, drinking cold sun tea, surrounded by the smell of her twelve acres of fresh-mowed California grass. There was a very pretty view. The sunset had been a spectacular dash of purple, and now the Berryessa mountains were shadowed in the west. Due south in the springtime, but not the summer, was a stream.</p><p>"Just listen to the frogs," Jocelyn said. We listened. Apparently, somewhere beneath the clamor of her kennel of barking dogs was a chorus of frogs.</p><p>She introduced us all to Grigg. He had brought the Gramercy edition of the complete novels, which suggested that Austen was merely a recent whim. We really could not approve of someone who showed up with an obviously new book, of someone who had the complete novels on his lap when only <i>Emma</i> was under discussion. Whenever he first spoke, whatever he said, one of us would have to put him in his place.</p><p>This person would not be Bernadette. Though she'd been the one to request girls only, she had the best heart in the world; we weren't surprised that she was making Grigg welcome. "It's so lovely to see a man taking an interest in Miss Austen," she told him. "Delightful to get the male perspective. We're so pleased that you're here." Bernadette never said anything once if it could be said three times. Sometimes this was annoying, but mostly it was restful. When she'd arrived, she seemed to have a large bat hanging over her ear. It was just a leaf, and Jocelyn removed it as they hugged.</p><p>Jocelyn had two portable heaters going, and the porch hummed cozily. There were Indian rugs and Spanish-tile floors of a red that might hide dog hair, depending on the breed. There were porcelain lamps in the shape of ginger jars, round and Oriental, and with none of the usual dust on the bulbs, because it was Jocelyn's house. The lamps were on timers. When it was sufficiently dark out, at the perfect moment, they would snap on all at once like a choir. This hadn't happened yet, but we were looking forward to it. Maybe someone would be saying something brilliant.</p><p>The only wall held a row of photographs-Jocelyn's dynasty of Ridgebacks, surrounded by their ribbons and pedigrees. Ridgebacks are a matriarchal breed; it's one of their many attractive features. Put Jocelyn in the alpha position and you have the makings of an advanced civilization.</p><p>Queenie of the Serengeti looked down on us, doe eyes and troubled, intelligent brow. It's hard to capture a dog's personality in a photograph; dogs suffer more from the flattening than people do, or cats even. Birds photograph well because their spirits are so guarded, and anyway, often the real subject is the tree. But this was a flattering likeness, and Jocelyn had taken it herself.</p><p>Beneath Queenie's picture, her daughter, Sunrise on the Sahara, lay, in the flesh, at our feet. She had only just settled, having spent the first half-hour moving from one of us to the next, puffing hot stagnant-pond smells into our faces, leaving hairs on our pants. She was Jocelyn's favorite, the only dog allowed inside, although she was not valuable, since she suffered from hyperthyroidism and had had to be spayed. It was a shame she wouldn't have puppies, Jocelyn said, for she had the sweetest disposition.</p><p>Jocelyn had recently spent more than two thousand dollars on vet bills for Sahara. We were glad to hear this; dog breeding, we'd heard, could make a person cruel and calculating. Jocelyn hoped to continue competing her, though the kennel would derive no benefit; it was just that Sahara missed it so. If her gait could be smoothed out-for Ridgebacks it was all about the gait-she could still show, even if she never won. (But Sahara knew when she'd lost; she became subdued and reflective. Sometimes someone was sleeping with the judge and there was nothing to be done about it.) Sahara's competitive category was Sexually Altered Bitch.</p><p>The barking outside ascended into hysteria. Sahara rose and walked stiffly to the screen door, her ridge bristling like a toothbrush.</p><p>"Why isn't Knightley more appealing?" Jocelyn began. "He has so many good qualities. Why don't I warm to him?"</p><p>We could hardly hear her; she had to repeat herself. The conditions were such, really, that we should have been discussing Jack London. . . .</p><p>Most of what we knew about Jocelyn came from Sylvia. Little Jocelyn Morgan and little Sylvia Sanchez had met at a Girl Scout camp when they were eleven years old, and they were fifty-something now. They'd both been in the Chippewa cabin, working on their wood-lore badges. They had to make campfires from teepees of kindling, and then cook over them, and then eat what they'd cooked; the requirement wasn't satisfied unless the Scout cleaned her plate. They had to identify leaves and birds and poisonous mushrooms. As if any one of them would ever eat a mushroom, poisonous or not.</p><p>For their final requirement they'd been taken in teams of four to a clearing ten minutes off and left to find their own way back. It wasn't hard, they'd been given a compass and a hint: The dining hall was southwest of them.</p><p>Camp lasted four weeks, and every Sunday Jocelyn's parents drove up from the city-three and a half hours-to bring her the Sunday funnies. "Everyone liked her anyway," Sylvia said. This was hard to believe, even for us, and we all liked Jocelyn a ton. "She was attractively ill informed."</p><p>Jocelyn's parents adored her so, they couldn't bear to see her unhappy. She'd never been told a story with a sad ending. She knew nothing about DDT or Nazis. She'd been kept out of school during the Cuban missile crisis because her parents didn't want her learning we had enemies.</p><p>"It fell to us Chippewas to tell her about communists," said Sylvia. "And child molesters. The Holocaust. Serial killers. Menstruation. Escaped lunatics with hooks for hands. The Bomb. What had happened to the real Chippewas.</p><p>"Of course, we didn't have any of it right. What a mash of misinformation we fed her. Still, it was realer than what she got at home. And she was very game, you had to admire her.</p><p>"It all came crashing down on the day we had to find our way back to camp. She had this paranoid fantasy that while we were hiking and checking our compass, they were packing up and moving out. That we would come upon the cabin and the dining hall and the latrines, but all the people would be gone. Even more, that there would be dust and spiderwebs and crumbling floorboards. It would be as if the camp had been abandoned for a hundred years. We might have told her too many <i>Twilight Zone</i> plots.</p><p>"But here's the weird part. On the last day, her parents came to pick her up, and on the drive back, they told her that they'd gotten divorced over the summer. In fact, she'd been sent off just for this purpose. All those Sunday drives together bringing the funnies, and they couldn't actually stand each other. Her dad was living in a hotel in San Francisco and had been the whole month she was gone. 'I eat all my meals in the hotel restaurant,' he told her. 'I just come down for breakfast and order whatever catches my fancy.' Jocelyn said he made it sound as though that were the only reason he'd moved out, because restaurant eating would be so swell. She felt she'd been traded for shirred eggs."</p><p>One day several years later he called her to say he had a touch of the flu. Nothing for her to worry her darling head about. They had tickets to a baseball game, but he didn't think he could make it, he'd have to take a rain check. Go, Giants! It turned out the flu was a heart attack. He didn't get to the hospital until he was already dead.</p><p>"No wonder she grew up a bit of a control freak," Sylvia said. With love. Jocelyn and Sylvia had been best friends for more than forty years. . . .</p><p>There's no heat with Mr. Knightley," Allegra said. She had a very expressive face, like Lillian Gish in a silent movie. She frowned when she was making a point, had done this since she was a tiny girl. "Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax meet in secret and quarrel with each other and make it up and lie to everyone they know. You believe they're in love because they behave so badly. You can imagine sex. You never feel that with Mr. Knightley." Allegra had a lullaby voice, low, yet penetrating. She was often impatient with us, but her tones were so soothing we usually realized it only afterward.</p><p>"That's true," Bernadette agreed. Behind the lenses of her tiny glasses her eyes were round as pebbles. "Emma is always saying how reserved Jane is, even Mr. Knightley says so, and he's so perceptive about everyone. But she's the only one in the whole book"-the lights came on, which made Bernadette jump, but she didn't miss a word for it-"who ever seems desperately in love. Austen says that Emma and Mr. Knightley make an unexceptional marriage." She paused reflectively. "Clearly she approves. I expect the word 'unexceptional' meant something different in Austen's day. Like, nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing to set tongues wagging. Neither reaching too high nor stooping too low."</p><p>Light poured like milk over the porch. Several large winged insects hurled themselves against the screens, frantic to find it, follow it to the source. This resulted in a series of thumps, some of them loud enough to make Sahara growl.</p><p>"No animal passion," said Allegra.</p><p>Sahara turned. Animal passion. She had seen things in the kennels. Things that would make your hair stand on end.</p><p>"No passion at all." Prudie repeated the word, but pronouncing it as if it were French. Pah-see-ohn. Because she taught French, this wasn't as thoroughly obnoxious as it might have been.</p><p>Not that we liked it. The month before, Prudie's beautician had removed most of her eyebrows; it gave her a look of steady surprise. We couldn't wait for this to go away. "<i>Sans passion, amour n'est rien,"</i> Prudie said.</p><p><i>"Apr�s moi, le deluge,"</i> Bernadette answered, just so Prudie's words wouldn't fall into a silence that might be mistaken for chilly. Bernadette was really too kind sometimes.</p><p>Nothing smelly outside. Sahara came away from the screen door. She leaned into Jocelyn, sighing. Then she circled three times, sank, and rested her chin on the gamy toe of Jocelyn's shoe. She was relaxed but alert. Nothing would get to Jocelyn that didn't go through Sahara first.</p><p>"If I may." Grigg cleared his throat, held up his hand. "One thing I notice about <i>Emma</i> is that there's a sense of menace." He counted off on his fingers. He wore no ring. "The violent Gypsies. The unexplained pilferings. Jane Fairfax's boat accident. All Mr. Woodhouse's worries. There's a sense of threat hovering on the edges. Casting its shadow."</p><p>Prudie spoke quickly and decisively. "But Austen's whole point is that none of those things is real. There is no real threat."</p><p>"I'm afraid you've missed the whole point," said Allegra.</p><p>Grigg said nothing further. His eyelashes dropped to his cheeks, making his expression hard to read. It fell to Jocelyn as hostess to change the subject.</p><p>"I read once that the <i>Emma</i> plot, the humbling of a pretty, self-satisfied girl, is the most popular plot of all time. I think it was Robertson Davies who said so. That this was the one story everyone was bound to enjoy."</p></p><h2>Forty Signs of Rain</h2><p>The bestselling author of the classic Mars trilogy and <b>The Years of Rice and Salt</b> returns with a riveting new trilogy of cutting-edge science, international politics, and the real-life ramifications of global warming as they are played out in our nation&#x2019;s capital&#x2014;and in the daily lives of those at the center of the action. Hauntingly realistic, here is a novel of the near future that is inspired by scientific facts already making headlines.<br><br>When the Arctic ice pack was first measured in the 1950s, it averaged thirty feet thick in midwinter. By the end of the century it was down to fifteen. One August the ice broke. The next year the breakup started in July. The third year it began in May. That was last year.<br><br>It&#x2019;s an increasingly steamy summer in the nation&#x2019;s capital as Senate environmental staffer Charlie Quibler cares for his young son and deals with the frustrating politics of global warming. Charlie must find a way to get a skeptical administration to act before it&#x2019;s too late&#x2014;and his progeny find themselves living in Swamp World. But the political climate poses almost as great a challenge as the environmental crisis when it comes to putting the public good ahead of private gain. <br><br>While Charlie struggles to play politics, his wife, Anna, takes a more rational approach to the looming crisis in her work at the National Science Foundation. There a proposal has come in for a revolutionary process that could solve the problem of global warming&#x2014;if it can be recognized in time. But when a race to control the budding technology begins, the stakes only get higher. As these everyday heroes fight to align the awesome forces of nature with the extraordinary march of modern science, they are unaware that fate is about to put an unusual twist on their work&#x2014;one that will place them at the heart of an unavoidable storm. <br><br>With style, wit, and rare insight into our past, present, and possible future, this captivating novel propels us into a world on the verge of unprecedented change&#x2014;in a time quite like our own.

A fierce inundation of photons&#x2014;on average, 342 joules per second per square meter. 4185 joules (one calorie) will raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. If all this energy were captured by the Earth's atmosphere, its temperature would rise by ten degrees Celsius in one day.<br><br>Luckily much of it radiates back to space. How much depends on albedo and the chemical composition of the atmosphere, both of which vary over time.<br><br>A good portion of Earth's albedo, or reflectivity, is created by its polar ice caps. If polar ice and snow were to shrink significantly, more solar energy would stay on Earth. Sunlight would penetrate oceans previously covered by ice, and warm the water. This would add heat and melt more ice, in a positive feedback loop.<br><br>The Arctic Ocean ice pack reflects back out to space a few percent of the total annual solar energy budget. When the Arctic ice pack was first measured by nuclear submarines in the 1950s, it averaged thirty feet thick in midwinter. By the end of the century it was down to fifteen. Then one August the ice broke up into large tabular bergs, drifting on the currents, colliding and separating, leaving broad lanes of water open to the continuous polar summer sunlight. The next year the breakup started in July, and at times more than half the surface of the Arctic Ocean was open water. The third year, the breakup began in May.<br><br>That was last year.<br>Weekdays always begin the same. The alarm goes off and you are startled out of dreams that you immediately forget. Predawn light in a dim room. Stagger into a hot shower and try to wake up all the way. Feel the scalding hot water on the back of your neck, ah, the best part of the day, already passing with the inexorable clock. Fragment of a dream, you were deep in some problem set now escaping you, just as you tried to escape it in the dream. Duck down the halls of memory&#x2014;gone. Dreams don't want to be remembered.<br><br>Evaluate the night's sleep. Anna Quibler decided the previous night had not been so good. She was exhausted already. Joe had cried twice, and though it was Charlie who had gotten up to reassure him, as part of their behavioral conditioning plan which was intended to convey to Joe that he would never again get Mom to visit him at night, Anna had of course woken up too, and vaguely heard Charlie's reassurances: "Hey. Joe. What's up. Go back to sleep, buddy, it's the middle of the night here. Nothing gets to happen until morning, so you might as well. This is pointless this wailing, why do you do this, good night damn it."<br><br>A brusque bedside manner at best, but that was part of the plan. After that she had tossed and turned for long minutes, trying heroically not to think of work. In years past she had recited in her head Edgar Allan Poe's poem "The Raven," which she had memorized in high school and which had a nice soporific effect, but then one night she had thought to herself, "Quoth the raven, 'Livermore,' " because of work troubles she was having with some people out at Lawrence Livermore. After that the poem was ruined as a sleep aid because the moment she even thought of The Raven she thought about work. In general Anna's thoughts had a tropism toward work issues.<br><br>Shower over, alas. She dried and dressed in three minutes. Downstairs she filled a lunch box for her older boy. Nick liked and indeed insisted that his lunch be exactly the same every day, so it was no great trouble to assemble it. Peanut butter sandwich, five carrots, apple, chocolate milk, yogurt, roll of lunch meat, cheese stick, cookie. Two minutes for that, then throw in a freeze pack to keep it chilled. As she got the coldpacks out of the freezer she saw the neat rows of plastic bottles full of her frozen milk, there for Charlie to thaw and feed to Joe during the day when she was gone. That reminded her, not that she would have forgotten much longer given how full her breasts felt, that she had to nurse the bairn before she left. She clumped back upstairs and lifted Joe out of his crib, sat on the couch beside it. "Hey love, time for some sleepy nurses."<br><br>Joe was used to this, and glommed onto her while still almost entirely asleep. With his eyes closed he looked like an angel. He was getting bigger but she could still cradle him in her arms and watch him curl into her like a new infant. Closer to two than one now, and a regular bruiser, a wild man who wearied her; but not now. The warm sensation of being suckled put her body back to sleep, but a part of her mind was already at work, and so she detached him and shifted him around to the other breast for four more minutes. In his first months she had had to pinch his nostrils together to get him to come off, but now a tap on the nose would do it, for the first breast at least. On the second one he was more recalcitrant. She watched the second hand on the big clock in his room sweep up and around. When they were done he would go back to sleep and snooze happily until about nine, Charlie said.<br><br>She hefted him back into his crib, buttoned up and kissed all her boys lightly on the head. Charlie mumbled "Call me, be careful." Then she was down the stairs and out the door, her big work bag over her shoulder.<br><br>The cool air on her face and wet hair woke her fully for the first time that day. It was May now and the late spring mornings had only a little bit of chill left to them, a delicious sensation given the humid heat that was to come. Fat gray clouds rolled just over the buildings lining Wisconsin Avenue. Truck traffic roared south. Splashes of dawn sunlight struck the metallic blue sheen of the windows on the skyscrapers up at Bethesda Metro, and as Anna walked briskly along it occurred to her, not for the first time, that this was one of the high points of her day. There were some disturbing implications in that fact, but she banished those and enjoyed the feel of the air and the tumble of the clouds over the city.<br><br>She passed the Metro elevator kiosk to extend her walk by fifty yards, then turned and clumped down the little stairs to the bus stop. Then down the big stairs of the escalator, into the dimness of the great tube of ribbed concrete that was the underground station. Card into the turnstile, thwack as the triangular barriers disappeared into the unit, pull her card out and through to the escalator down to the tracks. No train there, none coming immediately (you could hear them and feel their wind long before the lights set into the platform began to flash) so there was no need to hurry. She sat on a concrete bench that positioned her such that she could walk straight into the car that would let her out at Metro Center directly in the place closest to the escalators down to the Orange Line East.<br><br>At this hour she was probably going to find an open seat on the train when it arrived, so she opened her laptop and began to study one of the jackets, as they still called them: the grant proposals that the National Science Foundation received at a rate of fifty thousand a year. "Mathematical and Algorithmic Analysis of Palindromic Codons as Predictors of a Gene's Protein Expression." The project hoped to develop an algorithm that had shown some success in predicting which proteins any given gene sequence in human DNA would express. As genes expressed a huge variety of proteins, by unknown ways and with variations that were not understood, this kind of predicting operation would be a very useful thing if it could be done. Anna was dubious, but genomics was not her field. It would be one to give to Frank Vanderwal. She noted it as such and queued it in a forward to him, then opened the next jacket.<br><br>The arrival of a train, the getting on and finding of a seat, the change of trains at Metro Center, the getting off at the Ballston stop in Arlington, Virginia: all were actions accomplished without conscious thought, as she read or pondered the proposals she had in her laptop. The first one still struck her as the most interesting of the morning's bunch. She would be interested to hear what Frank made of it.<br>Coming up out of a Metro station is about the same everywhere: up a long escalator, toward an oval of gray sky and the heat of the day. Emerge abruptly into a busy urban scene.<br><br>The Ballston stop's distinction was that the escalator topped out in a big vestibule leading to the multiple glass doors of a building. Anna entered this building without glancing around, went to the nice little open-walled shop selling better-than-usual pastries and packaged sandwiches, and bought a lunch to eat at her desk. Then she went back outside to make her usual stop at the Starbucks facing the street.<br><br>This particular Starbucks was graced by a staff maniacally devoted to speed and precision; they went at their work like a drum and bugle corps. Anna loved to see it. She liked efficiency anywhere she found it, and more so as she grew older. That a group of young people could turn what was potentially a very boring job into a kind of strenuous athletic performance struck her as admirable and heartening. Now it cheered her once again to move rapidly forward in the long queue, and see the woman at the computer look up at her when she was still two back in line and call out to her teammates, "Tall latte half-caf, nonfat, no foam!" and then, when Anna got to the front of the line, ask her if she wanted anything else today.

Bestselling author and respected theologian Brian Walsh has followed Cockburn&#39;s work for years and has written and spoken often on his art. In this creative theological and cultural engagement, Walsh reveals the imaginative depth and uncompromising honesty of the artist&#39;s Christian spirituality. Cockburn offers hope in the midst of doubt, struggle, failure, and anger; indeed, the sentiment of &#34;kicking at the darkness&#34; is at the heart of his spirituality. This book engages the rich imagery of Cockburn&#39;s lyrics as a catalyst for shaping and igniting a renewed Christian imagination.</p><p><b>Christian Imagination and the Redemptive Work of Bruce Cockburn<br></b><br>"<i>Kicking at the Darkness</i> is a brilliant analysis of forty years of Bruce Cockburn's lyrics and their biblical and religious connections. Brian Walsh's explication is thoroughly researched and logical, and also compelling and entertaining. I read it from start to finish in one evening."<br>--<b>Joel Goldberg</b>, producer/director of <i>Bruce Cockburn, Pacing the Cage<br></i><br>"Brian Walsh has offered us an enthusiastic celebration of Bruce Cockburn as a postmodern psalmist. Walsh engages in sustained reflection on Cockburn's sometimes dark and obscure lyrics and shows how they reflect a deep Christian sensibility that cherishes creation, groans along with the pain of a corrupted world, and yearns for the final revelation of beauty and justice. Longtime fans of Cockburn like me will find fresh shafts of light falling on familiar words; those who haven't yet discovered Cockburn will find themselves beckoned to encounter a world-changing artistic vision."<br>--<b>Richard B. Hays</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Brian Walsh is not just a theologian; he's a poet and a farmer, a father and a husband. He's an intellectual who likes good music; he's a lover of culture and a critic of culture. In this book, Walsh examines a musical legend and shows us how Bruce Cockburn's work can point us to God and to God's redemptive action in the world."<br>--<b>Shane Claiborne</b>, author, activist, and recovering sinner, www.thesimpleway.org<br><br>"I've been listening to Cockburn for three decades and reading Walsh almost that long, and I can hardly imagine surviving these times, let alone believing that joy will find a way, without the artistry and insight of both. This is an extraordinarily ambitious project, years in the making, and there is profound insight on every page. I recommend it with great enthusiasm and with immense gratitude."<br>--<b>Byron Borger</b>, Hearts &amp; Minds Books<br><br>"What happens when one of the planet's leading Christian thinkers and writers engages with one of the planet's most brilliant songwriters and musicians?

So the man constructs a platform and eventually the eponymous tower, only to find that--as with all time-honored stories about reaching too high--it doesn't work.</p><p> As befits the Evans ethic, the story ends with a shot at redemption, and Jonathan Linton's vivid, photorealistic illustrations (though jarring at first) ably convey the young man's subtle transformation.

He has worked variously as a busboy, bike messenger, Frozade vender, substitute teacher, columnist, cable television host, comic, and dog walker. But he is best known as a wisecracking, self-described &#x2018;playground rat&#x2019; who used his beat-up Minolta and party-crashing skills to become a nightlife fixture and a chronicler of the then-exploding world of hip hop.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i> <br><br>For two decades, Ricky Powell has prowled the streets of his native New York, toured the world with Hip Hop&#x2019;s biggest acts, and full-on crashed celebrity-studded parties on both coasts. Equipped with only his wits and an instamatic camera, Powell elbowed his way into the center of the scene with no shame. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for public access,&#x201d; Powell could be heard, pleading for an interview with a pizza shop owner on his cult cable TV show, &#x201c;Rappin&#x2019; with the Rickster.&#x201d; <br><br> Powell knows access is everything, and he delivers. In <i><b>Public Access: Ricky Powell Photographs 1985&#x2013;2005</b></i>, Powell presents the actors, musicians, performers, and artists that inspired him, including Run-DMC, Public Enemy, Eric B. and Rakim, Slick Rick, Biz Markie, Eazy E, Method Man, LL Cool J, Fab 5 Freddy, Steven Tyler, Nina Hagen, John Sex, John Lee Hooker, LeRoy Neiman, Martha Graham, Elizabeth Taylor, Paloma Picasso, Calvin Klein, Barbara Walters, Grace Jones, Francis Ford Coppola, Sofia Coppola, Debi Mazar, Cindy Crawford, Elvira, Dondi, Doze, Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Andy Warhol, among many others. Also presented in <i>Public Access</i> are Powell&#x2019;s never-before-published collaborations with top artists, graffiti writers, and photographers including Ron Galella, Ron English, Phil Frost, Lee Quinones, Sam Flores, David Choe, Dalek, DR. REVOLT, ZEPHYR, QUIK, TEAM, DAZE, SEEN, KAWS, JEST, BIGFOOT, SSUR, and HAZE, among others.</p><p><b>Ricky Powell</b>, a native New Yorker, has been published in <i>The New York Times, the New York Post, the Daily News, The Village Voice, Time, Newsweek, VIBE, The Source, Rolling Stone, Spin, Details, Paper, Mass Appeal, Word Up!, Ego Trip</i>, and <i>Grand Royal</i>, to name a few. Powell&#x2019;s clients have included Cannon, MTV, NBC, the Apollo Theater, Capitol Records, and Weiden + Kennedy, among others. His work has been exhibited at the Eyejammie Fine Arts Gallery, New York and Upper Playground, San Francisco and was featured in &#x201c;500 of the Greatest Rock and Roll Photos,&#x201d; presented by Kodak. Powell is the author of <i>Frozade Moments: Classic NYC Street Photography</i> (Eyejammie, 2004), <i>The Rickford Files: Classic New York Photographs</i> (St. Martin&#x2019;s, 1999), and <i>Oh Snap!: The Rap Photography of Ricky Powell</i> (St. Martin&#x2019;s, 1998). He lives and works in New York. <br><br> <b>Charlie Ahearn</b> directed the classic Hip Hop movie <i>Wild Style</i> (1982) and recently coauthored <i>Yes Yes Y&#x2019;all: The Experience Music Project Oral History of Hip-Hop&#x2019;s First Decade</i> (Da Capo Press, 2002).

REVOLT</b> is an original member of the historic New York City graffiti crew <i>The Rolling Thunder Writers </i>(RTW). REVOLT created the classic &#x201c;YO! MTV Raps&#x201d; logo and has been exhibited in art galleries worldwide. <b>TEAM</b> is a graffiti writer, designer, and the former singer and songwriter of <i>Urban Blight</i>.Straight-up access with a chaser of attitude, this volume underscores both Powell's reportage style of photography and the tributary writings-both textual and graffiti-of contributors. Not a formally trained artist, Powell came up on the scene in his native New York City during the mid 1980s, took his 35 millimeter camera out of his pocket and captured the personalities that defined an era of urban history. Through his friendship with the Beastie Boys, Powell introduced himself to old-school rappers such as Slick Rick, LL Cool J, Run DMC, Biz Markie, Method Man, and legendary artists like Basquiat and Keith Haring. The collection of photographs is curiously egalitarian-a picture of a supermodel shares the page with a shot of an afghan hound-and images of ordinary people rank just as prominently as the picture of Powell himself with Andy Warhol. With graffiti by choice designers superimposed on some of the photographs, and letters to Powell that are simultaneously shout-outs to him and to another era of city life, the book is a collaborative construction much like a yearbook that annuals Powell's encounters with the world: a hectic convergence of talent, loosely organized, gritty but with disarming warmth in unexpected people and places.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is here where Scholem, who was associated with Hebrew University in Jerusalem, made his name, and his publications, usually short articles, laid the groundwork for a respectable study of the field. Scholem&#39;s KABBALAH is a major work, which opens with a large, encyclopedia-entry-length overview essay, in which he explains the Zohar, or Book of Splendor, and its influence, especially among Hasidic Jews. He follows with articles on various topics in Jewish mysticism, and then includes articles on key personalities, such as Sabbatei Sevi (on whom Scholem has written an entire book). While KABBALAH by Gershom Scholem it is not an easy read, it rewards those who venture forth.</p><p></p><h2>Flying the Line, Vol. 2: The Line Pilot in Crisis: ALPA Battles Airline Deregulation and Other Forces</h2><p>This volume explores in great depth the Association&#39;s history from that time through the incumbency of Capt.

This is a study of crisis and effect and contains priceless lessons that can be learned from past mistakes and successes.

Over half of all the species of birds in South America are included, thus making the book useful in regions adjacent to Colombia, as well as in the country itself. The primary purpose of the work is to enable observers to identify the birds of the region, but it also provides detailed species accounts and will serve as an important handbook and reference volume. Fifty-six lavish color plates, thirteen halftone plates, and ninety-nine line drawings in the text illustrate over 85% of the species, including most of the resident birds. Notes on the facing-page of each place, and range maps of 1,475 species, facilitate identification.</p><p>Written with the field observer in mind, the text gives special attention to comparisons of similar species, transcriptions of voices, and comments on behavior, status, and habitat. It also provides ranges, breeding data, and references. Notes outline taxonomic problems and briefly describe species that eventually may be found in Colombia. Introductory chapters and photographs highlight Colombia's geography, climate, and vegetation, and discuss migration and conservation questions, and the history of Colombian ornithology. Appendices contain a large bibliography, a section on birding locations, and coverage of two of Colombia's far-flung island territories, Isla San Andr�s and Providencia. Maps depicting vegetation zones, political boundaries, national parks, and the most text localities are included.</p></p><p><b>Steven L.

He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost 4 years) and in England. He returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917 but was disappointed by the Bolshevik form of state socialism.Kropotkin was a proponent of a decentralised communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations of self-governing communities and worker-run enterprises. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, and his principal scientific offering, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution. He also contributed the article on anarchism to the Encyclop�dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, and left unfinished a work on anarchist ethical philosophy.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Brotherhood of the Grape</h2><p><p> Henry Molise, a 50 year old, successful writer, returns to the family home to help with the latest drama; his aging parents want to divorce. Henry's tyrannical, brick laying father, Nick, though weak and alcoholic, can still strike fear into the hearts of his sons. His mother, though ill and devout to her Catholicism, still has the power to comfort and confuse her children. This is typical of Fante's novels, it's autobiographical, and brimming with love, death, violence and religion. Writing with great passion Fante powerfully hits home the damage family can wreck upon us all. </p></p><p>Born in Denver on 8 April 1909, John Fante migrated to Los Angeles in his early twenties. Classically out of place in a town built on celluloid dreams, Fante&#39;s literary fiction was full of torn grace and redemptive vengeance. Wait Until Spring, Bandini (1938), his first novel, began the saga of Arturo Bandini, a character whose story continues in The Road to Los Angeles, Ask the Dust and Dreams from Bunker Hill - collectively known as The Bandini Quartet. Fante published several other novels, as well as stories, novellas and screenplays in his seventy-four years, including The Brotherhood of the Grape (1977) and 1933 Was A Bad Year (posthumously, 1985). He was posthumously recognised in 1987 with a Lifetime Achievement Award by PEN in Los Angeles, four years after his death from diabetes-related complications.Fante's searing, effortless style eschewed the refinement of Fitzgerald, the hubris of Hemingway and the panoramic vistas of Dos Passos. Instead he marshalled the raw materials of his own life - poverty, sex, paternal hatred, Catholic guilt, misplaced pride, hard drinking, labour, fighting, overarching literary ambition and the internecine hatred within immigrant communities in pre-war America - rendering the pain and comedy with such heartbreaking simplicity as to brook no hint of the literary zeitgeist. * * Dazed &amp; Confused * * John Fante takes some beating . . . mean, moody, disturbing and intensely atmospheric. * * The Times * * John Fante knew how to make words sing. When he was on form, he could write sentences that stopped time. * * Uncut * * Bandini is a magnificent creation, and his rediscovery is not before time. * * Times Literary Supplement * * Fante was my God. -- Charles Bukowski</p><h2>The People of the Secret</h2><p>Are biological evolution and human history directed by a hierarchy of Intelligences, the lowest level of which makes physical contact with mankind?

As it is a national, not a regional institution, the Museum does not restrict its collection by location, nor is it restricted by time period: The quilts have been made all over the country and range in date from the late-eighteenth to the late-twentieth century.<br>Until this publication, however, there has been no comprehensive guide to the Museum's quilts, almost all of which have been donated by collectors in the field. Highlights from the collection have been published and exhibited many times, but the purpose of this book is to provide an opportunity for quiltmakers, collectors, scholars, and others to explore the collection in depth. The comprehensive discussion of the quilts has been divided into eleven chapters that are illustrated with 141 color plates. This text is then followed by a catalog of the entire collection, which in turn contains forty-four black-and-white illustrations. Here, then, is a richly handsome and informative volume that will prove to be essential for all those fascinated by this category of American folk art.</p><p></p><h2>Jack Kemp: The Bleeding-Heart Conservative Who Changed America</h2><p><b>"THE PURPOSE OF POLITICS IS NOT TO DEFEAT YOUR OPPONENT AS MUCH AS IT IS TO PROVIDE SUPERIOR LEADERSHIP AND BETTER IDEAS THAN THE OPPOSITION." &#x2014;JACK KEMP</b><br><br>The late 1970s were miserable for America.

In the 1980s, it all turned around: "stagflation" ended and nearly two decades of prosperity ensued. The Soviet Union retreated, then collapsed. America again believed in itself. And around the world, democratic capitalism was deemed "the end of history."<br><br>Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s policies sparked the American renaissance, but the Gipper&#x2019;s leadership is only part of the story. The economic theory that underpinned America&#x2019;s success was pioneered by a star professional quarterback turned self-taught intellectual and "bleeding-heart conservative": Jack Kemp.<br><br>Kemp&#x2019;s role in a pivotal period in American history is at last illuminated in this first-ever biography, which also has lessons for the politics of today. Kemp was the congressional champion of supply-side economics&#x2014;the idea that lowering taxes would foster growth. Even today, almost no one advocates a return to a top income tax rate of 70 percent. <br>Kemp didn&#x2019;t just challenge the Democratic establishment. He also encouraged his fellow Republicans to be growth (not austerity) minded, open their tent to minorities and blue-collar workers, battle poverty and discrimination, and once again become "the party of Lincoln." <br><br>Kemp approached politics the same way he played quarterback for the Buffalo Bills: with a refusal to accept defeat. Yet he also was incapable of personal attack, arguing always on the level of ideas. He regarded opponents as adversaries, not enemies, and often cooperated with them to get things done. Despite many ups and downs, including failed presidential and vice-presidential bids, he represented a positive, idealistic, compassionate Republicanism. <br><br>Drawing on never-published papers and more than one hundred Kemp Oral History Project interviews, noted journalists Morton Kondracke and Fred Barnes trace Kemp&#x2019;s life, from his childhood through his pro football career to his influential years as a congressman and cabinet secretary.<br><br>As the American Dream seems to be waning and polarized politics stifles Washington, Kemp is a model for what politics ought to be.

His life and legacy need to be recognized&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s starting to happen. In this era of political bleakness, both Republicans and Democrats are citing him as a model of what politicians ought to be. That is one of the four reasons why we have written this book.</p><p>Above all, Jack Kemp merits a prominent place in American political history because he was Congress&#x2019;s foremost advocate for supply-side economics and the man who steered Ronald Reagan toward adopting it. Hence, he deserves partial credit for not only pulling America out of the deep malaise of the 1970s but also for helping to win the cold war and convert much of the world to democratic capitalism.</p><p>The &#x2019;70s were a dismal decade. It was the era of stagflation&#x2014;simultaneous high unemployment and soaring inflation. And also of geopolitical reverses: it was the post&#x2013;Vietnam era, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan; its Cuban allies advanced in Africa and Central America; and revolutionary Iran held Americans hostage for 444 days. And it was an era of bottomed-out national morale&#x2014;its nadir when President Carter blamed the acquisitiveness of the American people for the country&#x2019;s seemingly incurable ills.</p><p>In the 1980s it all turned around. The &#x201c;misery index&#x201d; (unemployment plus inflation) fell from 23 in 1980 to 7.7 in 1986.2 The Soviet empire retreated, tried to reform itself, and then collapsed. Among American citizens, satisfaction with the condition of the country rose from a low of 12 percent in July 1979 to 69 percent in June of 1986.3 And around the world&#x2014;especially in Eastern Europe, but also in Latin America and Asia&#x2014;democratic capitalism was deemed to be &#x201c;the end of history.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack Kemp was at the center of the great turnaround. He did not invent supply-side economics: the combination of lower tax rates, particularly on individual income, and a stable dollar. That was the work of two young economists, Robert Mundell, later a Nobel Prize winner, and Arthur Laffer. But once converted by journalist-agitator Jude Wanniski of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, Kemp became the leading political evangelist of the supply-side movement. Lowering tax rates, he argued, would create incentives for work, savings, and investment&#x2014;and produce booming growth in a way that Keynesian public spending programs had not. His tax bill&#x2014;Kemp-Roth, a three-year, 30 percent across-the-board cut borrowed from John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s 1963 proposal&#x2014;became the vehicle for the supply-side revolution.</p><p>Kemp&#x2019;s enthusiasm for supply-side economics was contagious, and he spearheaded a national movement that amounted to both a political and intellectual revolution in economics. In Congress, senior Republicans resented the presumptuous backbencher, still in his forties, who was treading on tax turf. They also doubted his economics. But junior Republicans unhappy with their party&#x2019;s lack of vitality joined Kemp&#x2019;s campaign&#x2014;among them the future Speaker Newt Gingrich, the future Senate majority leader Trent Lott, future senators Connie Mack and Dan Coats, and longtime party leader Vin Weber. Kemp forged links with policy thinkers in Washington and New York, including Irving Kristol and Mundell, and Robert Bartley, editorial page editor of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Kemp&#x2019;s office and living room became scenes resembling graduate seminars where the Washington&#x2012;New York nexus came together for debate, but with major policy change as its aim. That aim was achieved; Kemp-Roth became official party policy in 1978. Even GOP graybeards who had previously scorned him signed on.</p><p>Then he recruited Ronald Reagan, who made Kemp&#x2019;s proposal a centerpiece of his 1980 presidential campaign and, once elected, the basis of Reaganomics. The Reagan tax cuts of 1981 and 1986&#x2014;reducing the top rate from 70 percent to 50 percent, then 28 percent&#x2014;set off an economic boom that lasted into the 2000s.</p><p>The achievements of the 1980s were mainly Reagan&#x2019;s, but their economic underpinning was Kemp&#x2019;s. No Republican politician of the twentieth century who was not president transformed the country the way he did&#x2014;not Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Taft, or Nelson Rockefeller. Earl Warren did, but as chief justice, not as governor of California. Nor did any Democrats except possibly Hubert Humphrey, the leading early advocate for civil rights, and Edward Kennedy, author or bipartisan coauthor of dozens of health, education, and civil rights laws.</p><p>_____</p><p>Our second reason for writing about Kemp is that he embodied a spirit sorely missing in today&#x2019;s politics&#x2014;in both parties. Kemp was positive, optimistic, idealistic, energetic, growth- and opportunity-oriented. He was incapable of personal attack and negative campaigning, even when it cost him. &#x201c;The purpose of politics,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is not to defeat your opponent as much as it is to provide superior leadership and better ideas than the opposition.&#x201d;4 He criticized liberals and Democrats, but also &#x201c;green-eyeshade,&#x201d; austerity-minded, &#x201c;Herbert Hoover&#x201d; Republicans. His criticisms were always based on their ideas and policy proposals, never their motives or personal flaws. He believed&#x2014;as he said again and again&#x2014;that &#x201c;ideas change history.&#x201d; He wanted to change history for the better.</p><p>He wanted his own party to once again be &#x201c;the party of Lincoln.&#x201d; Even before very conservative audiences, he argued that the GOP should again become the &#x201c;natural home of African-Americans,&#x201d; as it had been from Lincoln&#x2019;s time to Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s. He insisted it could happen if Republican policies brought growth and prosperity to inner cities. It was unrealistic, probably romantic. But it was sincere. It was famously said of him that as a pro-football star, he&#x2019;d &#x201c;showered with more African-Americans than most Republicans had ever met.&#x201d; He lamented that his party had been largely absent from the civil rights movement and regarded the &#x201c;Southern strategy&#x201d; to win white votes at the expense of blacks a &#x201c;disgrace.&#x201d;5</p><p>Kemp believed in what he called the American Idea&#x2014;that the Declaration of Independence was a universal document, that everyone everywhere deserved the right to advance as far as his or her talent and effort would lead. The American idea was Kemp&#x2019;s version of Lincoln&#x2019;s bedrock principle that the &#x201c;right to rise&#x201d; was the central idea of the United States and applied to black slaves as well as white workers.6 And like Lincoln, he believed it was the job of government to enable people to achieve their aims and remove obstacles&#x2014;especially, in Kemp&#x2019;s view, high taxes.</p><p>We hope this book will inspire&#x2014;or embarrass&#x2014;present-day politicians to see there is a better way to conduct their business. To fight, yes, but over ideas for making America better. And to search for common ground to solve America&#x2019;s problems and secure a future for every citizen.</p><p>_____</p><p>Our third reason for writing this book is simply that Jack Kemp led a fascinating, inspiring life. His father, Paul, was his model of entrepreneurial capitalism. His well-educated mother, Frances, was his cultural and intellectual spur. They both were Christian Scientists, which produced in Kemp a lifelong optimism, a faith that thinking positively can change the future, that failure is never final, that &#x201c;when one door closes, another opens.&#x201d;</p><p>Kemp grew up a sports fanatic, deciding at age five that he wanted to be a professional quarterback. By will and determination, he overcame repeated obstacles and became one, a star quarterback, first for the San Diego Chargers, then the Buffalo Bills. He remained a quarterback in mentality all his life. He was a natural leader, the captain of nearly every team he ever joined and president of the American Football League Players Association. In the turbulent 1960s, he fostered racial integration of AFL teams and cities. He never stopped applying lessons from football to life and politics&#x2014;quarterbacking as capitalism, the huddle as cooperative endeavor, booing as no big deal, the next play as the chance to win.</p><p>He was a physical education major and a mediocre student at California&#x2019;s Occidental College, but he became a self-taught intellectual&#x2014;deeply read in economics, an expert in defense and foreign policy, and an avid consumer of history books, especially biographies of his heroes Lincoln and Winston Churchill. After Reagan won the presidency, Kemp became the number three leader of House Republicans. He was a Reagan loyalist but had the courage to oppose his president&#x2014;and took heat for it&#x2014;when he thought Reagan was being led astray on economic and foreign policy.</p><p>In 1988, he was deemed by many to be Reagan&#x2019;s natural political heir. He ran for president urging voters to join him in &#x201c;the progressive, conservative, radical, revolutionary Lincoln Emancipation wing of the Republican Party.&#x201d;7 He finished a distant third behind conventional Republicans George H. W. Bush and Bob Dole. As Bush&#x2019;s housing secretary, he fought a losing battle to make the plight of the urban poor a national priority. He also could not resist meddling in foreign and economic matters not in his portfolio. His fellow cabinet members were not amused.</p><p>After Bush lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, Kemp started out as the clear favorite of the party faithful for 1996. But he lost support by opposing California&#x2019;s anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994 and otherwise flouting conservative Republican orthodoxy. He passed on running. Then he was plucked from near obscurity by Dole, his long-standing foe, to run for vice president. But he couldn&#x2019;t do what number twos are expected to do&#x2014;attack the opposition. Bill Clinton&#x2019;s ethics, personal and political, were a ripe target, but in debate with Vice President Al Gore, he whiffed.</p><p>The Dole-Kemp candidacy was doomed in any event because the president was popular and peace and prosperity reigned. But Kemp made a statement late in the race in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that summarized his experience and mentality:</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, almost forty years ago, I started my professional career with the Detroit Lions as their third-string quarterback. And they said I would never make it. I came from the wrong schools. I was too short. I threw too hard. I was too optimistic. I didn&#x2019;t have it. I tell you what. I never gave up. I got traded, sold, hurt, cut, booed, knocked out, but I never gave up. Bob Dole in his career never gave up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are fighters. We believe in the American dream.&#x201d;8</p><p>_____</p><p>Personally, writing this book has given us the opportunity to revisit our experience as journalists. Barnes, who became a conservative in the 1970s and was a close friend of Kemp&#x2019;s foremost journalistic booster, columnist Bob Novak, got to know Kemp in 1981. Curious about what supply-side economics was all about, he traveled with Kemp to Buffalo for a weekend and scarcely got to ask a question. Kemp talked nonstop, determined (as always) to make a convert. Thereafter, Barnes interviewed Kemp numerous times, got close to his staff, and wrote dozens of articles about him, his favorite issues, and his political prospects, first in the <i>Baltimore</i> <i>Sun</i>, then in the<i> New Republic</i>. He and his family became friends of the Kemps as well. His wife, Barbara, still attends Joanne Kemp&#x2019;s weekly Bible study meetings, and his daughter, Karen, was active in Kemp&#x2019;s presidential campaign in Virginia in 1988. She was slated to attend the Republican National Convention, but didn&#x2019;t after Kemp lost the state&#x2019;s primary.</p><p>Kondracke, once a liberal (though not very), was pitted every week against Bob Novak on TV&#x2019;s <i>McLaughlin</i> <i>Group</i> and was a longtime supply-side skeptic who thought Reagan&#x2019;s admitted economic successes were the result of Keynesian deficit spending, not tax cuts. Kondracke knew Kemp, admired his &#x201c;bleeding heart&#x201d; predilections and obvious sincerity, and wrote about him intermittently for the Capitol Hill newspaper <i>Roll Call</i>. Then, in 2011, he was retained by the Jack Kemp Foundation to conduct more than a hundred recorded interviews for its Oral History Project. He then spent two academic years holding the Jack Kemp Chair in Political Economy at the John W. Kluge Center for Scholars at the Library of Congress researching Kemp&#x2019;s career. He&#x2019;s read Kemp&#x2019;s words and seen him through the eyes of fellow football players, staff members, congressional and cabinet colleagues, other journalists, and the Kemp family.9 All of which has deepened his respect, especially for Kemp&#x2019;s courage in bucking his party and even his president, his inclusiveness, and his refusal to see politics (in Newt Gingrich&#x2019;s phrase) as &#x201c;war without bloodshed.&#x201d; Kondracke asked numerous interviewees how it was that this competitive star, playing one of America&#x2019;s most violent sports, wouldn&#x2019;t &#x201c;hit&#x201d; a political opponent. The repeated answer was: &#x201c;Because he was a quarterback!&#x201d;</p><p>_____</p><p>Finally, and most important, we have written this book because we believe that America is in trouble, perhaps more deeply in trouble than in the 1970s. And we think that Jack Kemp&#x2019;s spirit&#x2014;and his policy ideas&#x2014;could again help the country turn around.</p><p>The American Dream is dimming. Workers have the <i>right </i>to rise, but they are not rising. The median income of American households in 2013 was 8.7 percent below what it was in 1999 after climbing by 20 percent during the &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s.10 At the same time, workers&#x2019; contributions toward health-care premiums have risen almost four times faster than their wages.11 People born in the lowest fifth in income distribution have just a 9 percent chance of reaching the top fifth, showing no improvement over the past thirty years. And there has been no progress in fifty years in closing the wealth gap between whites and minorities.12 As the economy recovers from the Great Recession, 95 percent of the nation&#x2019;s income gains have been reaped by the top 1 percent of earners.13 Meantime, while the official unemployment rate has dropped, the underemployment rate has recovered much less.14 And millions have dropped out of the labor force.</p><p>The slowing of economic opportunity has deleterious psychological, social, and political effects. In 1992, 41 percent of Americans were confident that their children&#x2019;s lives would be better than theirs; in mid-2014, only 21 percent were optimistic. A CNN/ORC (Opinion Research Corporation) poll showed 59 percent believed &#x201c;the American dream has become impossible for most people to achieve.&#x201d;15 Whether it&#x2019;s a cause or an effect, America&#x2019;s social capital is also flagging. The out-of-wedlock birthrate, heavily correlated with a life of poverty, has doubled since 1980.16</p><p>In a speech to the 1979 International Longshoremen&#x2019;s Association convention, Kemp said that &#x201c;in a stagnant or contracting economy, politics becomes the art of pitting class against class, rich against poor, white against black, capital against labor, Sunbelt against Snowbelt, old against young.&#x201d;17 The increasingly savage polarization of American politics today is at least partly the result of citizens&#x2019; fear and anger that &#x201c;others&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;the 1 percent&#x201d; or &#x201c;the 47 percent&#x201d;&#x2014;are profiteering at their expense.</p><p>This pola...</p></p><h2>In Every Tiny Grain of Sand: A Child&#39;s Book of Prayers and Praise</h2><p><b>Commemorate the holidays&#x2014;or anytime&#x2014;with exquisitely illustrated prayers and poetry from around the world.

Do you have a hankering to don an engineer's cap and race a locomotive under tunnels and over bridges? Loaded with flaps, pull-tabs, 3-D trains, and a spectacular pop-up model of a bustling railroad station, Robert Crowther's sturdy exploration of trains and how they work is a tour de force of paper engineering and a bonanza for railroad aficionados of all ages. What's more, it's filled to the brim with fun facts and intriguing information lurking behind, around, and even on top of its many marvelous, movable trains.</p><p>Robert Crowther discovered the wonders of 3-D illustration while still in art school and has since created numerous acclaimed pop-up books, including COLORS, OPPOSITES, SHAPES, and LET&#39;S COOK! He lives in Norfolk, England.Grade 2-4&#x2013;With pop-up effects that, appropriately enough, tend to be long, narrow, and placed in parallel tracks, this history of railroading opens with outside and inside views of a small steam locomotive and closes with a full-spread, double-tiered train station. In between, the book covers methods of propulsion, the development of passenger cars, speed and other records, tunnels, bridges, and other engineering feats. A mix of boldface titles and brief remarks, the text is printed both between and on or under moving parts&#x2013;the latter adding another element of discovery for eager flap-lifters and tab-pullers. Crowther simplifies technological details in his neat, brightly colored collage illustrations, so this outing will draw a younger audience of trainiacs than the likes of Fiona Conboy's <i>Ten Terrific Trains</i> (Dutton, 1998).<i>&#x2013;John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The ompany and its dances inspired artists of every medium from Manhattan to St. Petersburg to Paris to myriad cultural havens around the world.<p>Oversize and replete with lavish color, <em>Tributes</em> is a showcase for the exquisite art, sets, costumes, photography, poetry, and writing the City Ballet has inspired in the great creative minds of our time. An impressionistic portrait of the American treasure, <em>Tributes</em> pays homage to the Ballet and to the people who created it -- from George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein to Jerome Robbins and Peter Martins, to the dancers, artists, and composers whose artistic fantasies became stunning reality on stage.</p><p>Boasting the most comprehensive repertory list to span the Company's fifty-year history and a complete chronology discography, and videography, <em>Tributes</em> is also a definitive history of the Company.</p><p>This is an elegant celebration of New York City Ballet with full-color art and writing from the century's greatest artists and authors, who have been entranced and seduced by the premier dance company in the world. A luxurious celebration of New York City Ballet, <em>Tributes</em> is a must-have for every balletomane and lover of the arts.</p><p></p></p><p>The experience of dance is ephemeral. A lilting arabesque, an ascendant grand jet�, a precise pirouette--such movements exist for just a single moment. But the sensations they communicate to an audience member can be lasting. New York City Ballet has been one of America's preeminent companies since 1948. In <i>Tributes</i>, dancers, writers, and artists express their feelings for the company and its members to form an impressionistic view that captures the illusory essence of the ballet experience. Peter Martins, who inherited the role of artistic director upon the death of George Balanchine, opens the book by remembering how he only realized what ballet truly was the first time he danced with the company. City Ballet's creative triumvirate--Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Lincoln Kirstein--are recalled in an evocative set of essays. And from there, each page contains a gem that will take readers back to the first time they saw Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins perform the "Diamonds" pas de deux in <i>Jewels</i>, or watched Edward Villela in <i>Watermill</i>.<p> The thrill of observing these unearthly creatures practice their art--defying the laws of physics and the constraints of mere mortals--is palpable on every page. Henri Cartier-Bresson captures George Balanchine rehearsing his company. Agnes De Mille describes Jerome Robbins's "elements of style." The backdrops Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Robert Rauschenberg, and Erte designed for the company are here, along with the posters Roy Lichtenstein and Keith Haring created to advertise the company's presence at the 1988 American Music Festival. Poet James Merrill, illustrator Al Hirschfeld, artist Joseph Cornell, architect Phillip Johnson, and historian Robert Caro all pay homage to their favorite dancers. The list of luminaries who contributed to the book is too long to detail here, but each of their perspectives is unexpected and exciting. Playwright Wendy Wasserstein writes: "Nothing makes more sense to me than a night at the ballet.... Some girls want to have breakfast at Tiffany's, I just want a glass of champagne during the interval between <i>Glass Pieces</i> and <i>Scotch Symphony</i> on the State Theater Promenade." Ms. Wasserstein, an evening spent perusing this book is the next best thing. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p><strong>Peter Martins</strong> was born in Denmark and began his association with the New York City Ballet thirty years ago. George Balanchine appointed him a ballet master in 1981 and since 1990 he has been ballet master in chief. Acclaimed as a dancer and choreographer, he lives in New York City with his wife, Darci Kistler, and their daughter, Talicia.</p><h2>The General in His Labyrinth</h2><p>General Simon Bolivar, &#39;the Liberator&#39; of five South American countries, takes a last melancholy journey down the Magdalena River, revisiting cities along its shores, and reliving the triumphs, passions and betrayals of his life. Infinitely charming, prodigiously successful in love, war and politics, he still dances with such enthusiasm and skill that those watching cannot believe he is ill. Aflame with memories of the power that he commanded and the dream of continental unity that eluded him, he is a moving exemplar of how much can be won - and lost - in a life.</p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating tour de force and a moving tribute to an extraordinary man&#x201d; --Margaret Atwood, <i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;A distinguished book. . . .

Sontag introduced Nunez to her son, the writer David Rieff, and the two began dating. Soon Nunez had moved into the apartment that Rieff and Sontag shared. Described by Nunez as "a natural mentor," Sontag inevitably infected those around her with her many cultural and intellectual passions. Her influence on Nunez would be profound, and Nunez looks back with gratitude for having had, as an early model, "someone who held such an exalted, unironic view of the writer's vocation." For a young woman who yearned to become a writer, says Nunez, meeting Sontag was one of the luckiest strokes of her life. Published more than six years after Sontag's death, this book is a startlingly truthful portrait of this outsize personality, who made being an intellectual a glamorous occupation.</p><p><b>Sigrid Nunez</b> is the author of six novels, including A FEATHER ON THE BREATH OF GOD, THE LAST OF HER KIND and SALVATION CITY. Among her honors and awards are a Whiting Writers' Award, a Berlin Prize, and the Rome Prize in Literature.<p></p><p>IT WAS MY first time ever going to a writers&#x2019; colony, and, for some reason I no longer recall, I had to postpone the date on which I was supposed to arrive. I was concerned that arriving late would be frowned on. But Susan insisted this was not a bad thing. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always good to start off anything by breaking a rule.&#x201d; For her, arriving late<i> was</i> the rule. &#x201c;The only time I worry about being late is for a plane or for the opera.&#x201d; When people complained about always having to wait for her, she was unapologetic. &#x201c;I figure, if people aren&#x2019;t smart enough to bring along something to read&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; (But when certain people wised up and she ended up having to wait for them, she was not pleased.)</p><p>My own fastidious punctuality could get on her nerves. Out to lunch with her one day, realizing I was going to be late getting back to work, I jumped up from the table, and she scoffed, &#x201c;Sit down! You don&#x2019;t have to be there on the dot. Don&#x2019;t be so servile.&#x201d; <i>Servile</i> was one of her favorite words.</p><p><i>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</i></p><p><i>Exceptionalism</i>. Was it really a good idea for the three of us&#x2014;Susan, her son, myself&#x2014;to share the same household? Shouldn&#x2019;t David and I get a place of our own? She said she saw no reason why we couldn&#x2019;t all go on living together, even if David and I were to have a child. She&#x2019;d gladly support us all if she had to, she said. And when I expressed doubts: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so conventional. Who says we have to live like everyone else?&#x201d;</p><p>(Once, on St. Mark&#x2019;s Place, she pointed out two eccentric-looking women, one middle-aged, the other elderly, both dressed like gypsies and with long, flowing gray hair. &#x201c;Old bohemians,&#x201d; she said. And she added, jokingly, &#x201c;Us in thirty years.&#x201d; </p><p>More than thirty years have passed, and she is dead, and there is no bohemia anymore.)</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>She was forty-three when we met, but she seemed very old to me. This was partly because I was twenty-five, and at that age anyone over forty seemed old to me. But it was also because she was recuperating from a radical mastectomy. (Break a rule: when hospital staff scolded her for refusing to do the recommended rehabilitation exercises, a sympathetic nurse whispered in her ear, &#x201c;Happy Rockefeller wouldn&#x2019;t do them, either.&#x201d;) Her skin was sallow, and her hair&#x2014;it would always bewilder me that so many people thought she bleached the white streak in her hair when it should have been obvious the streak was the only part that was its true color. (A hairdresser suggested that leaving one section undyed would look less artificial.) Chemotherapy had thinned much but not all of her extraordinarily thick, black hair, but the hair that grew back was mostly white or gray.</p><p>So, an odd thing: when we first met, she looked older than she would as I got to know her. As her health returned, she looked younger and younger, and when she decided to color her hair she looked younger still.</p><p>It was spring, 1976, almost a year after I&#x2019;d finished my MFA at Columbia, and I was living on West 106th Street. Susan, who lived at the corner of 106th Street and Riverside Drive, had a pile of unanswered correspondence she had let accumulate during her illness and which she now wanted to get through. She asked some friends, the editors of <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, to recommend someone who might help her. I had worked as an editorial assistant at the <i>Review</i> between college and grad school. The editors knew that I could type and that I lived nearby, so they suggested that she call me. It was exactly the kind of odd job I was looking for then: the kind unlikely to interfere with my writing. </p><p>The first day I went to 340 Riverside Drive, it was sunny, and the apartment&#x2014;a penthouse with many large windows&#x2014;was blindingly bright. We worked in Susan&#x2019;s bedroom, I at her desk, typing on her massive IBM Selectric while she dictated, either pacing the room or lying on her bed. The room, like the rest of the apartment, was austerely furnished; the walls were white and bare. As she later explained, because this was where she worked, she wanted as much white space around her as possible, and she tried to keep the room as free as possible of books. I don&#x2019;t remember any pictures of family or friends (in fact, I can recall no such pictures on display anywhere in that apartment); instead, there were a few black-and-white photos (like the kind that came in publishers&#x2019; publicity packets) of some of her literary heroes: Proust, Wilde, Artaud (a volume of whose selected writings she had just finished editing), Walter Benjamin. Elsewhere in the apartment there were a number of photographs of old movie stars, and stills from famous old black-and-white films. (These, as I recall, had previously decorated the lobby of the New Yorker Theater, the revival house at 88th Street and Broadway.)</p><p>She was wearing a loose turtleneck shirt, jeans, and Ho Chi Minh tire flip-flops, which I believe she had brought back from one of her trips to North Vietnam. Because of the cancer, she was trying to quit smoking (she would try and fail and try again, time after time). She went through a whole jar of corn nuts, washing them down with swigs from a plastic gallon jug of water.</p><p>The pile of letters was daunting; it would take many hours to get through, but what made our progress absurdly slow was that the phone kept ringing, and each time it rang she would pick up and chat (in some cases for quite some time) while I sat there, waiting, and, of course, listening, sometimes petting her son&#x2019;s large, attention-seeking malamute dog. Most of the callers were people whose names I knew. I gathered she was appalled at the way many people were responding to the news of her cancer. (Though I didn&#x2019;t know it yet, she was already working out ideas for what would become her essay &#x201c;Illness as Metaphor.&#x201d;) I remember her describing cancer to one of her callers as &#x201c;the imperial disease.&#x201d; I heard her say to several people that the recent deaths of Lionel Trilling and Hannah Arendt had left her feeling &#x201c;orphaned.&#x201d; Fierce indignation as she reported someone saying of Trilling that it was no wonder he&#x2019;d gotten cancer since he probably hadn&#x2019;t fucked his wife in years. (&#x201c;And this was an <i>academic</i> speaking.&#x201d;) She hated to admit it, but she bravely did: one of her own first thoughts when she&#x2019;d been told she had cancer was &#x201c;Did I not have enough sex?&#x201d;</p><p>Once, it was her son who called. A year younger than I, David, who&#x2019;d dropped out of Amherst, had recently returned to school and was now a sophomore at Princeton. He had a place to stay in Princeton, but most of the week he lived with his mother. His (soon to be our) bedroom was right next to hers.</p><p>The work bored her. After we&#x2019;d taken care of only a few letters, she suggested we break for lunch. I followed her to the other end of the apartment, passing through halls lined with books, and a dining area, where I admired a long, elegant wood table with matching wood benches (an old French farmhouse table, she informed me), and a framed vintage Olivetti poster (&#x201c;<i>la rapidissima</i>&#x201d;) hanging on the wall behind it. The dining table was usually covered with books and papers, and most meals were eaten in the kitchen, at a wood counter someone had painted dark blue.</p><p>I sat on a stool at the counter feeling very self-conscious while she heated up a can of Campbell&#x2019;s Cream of Mushroom soup. Add a can of milk and there was enough for two. It surprised me that she was so conversational. I was used to the hierarchical world of <i>The New York</i> <i>Review</i>, whose editors never made conversation with the staff. That day, I learned that the apartment&#x2019;s previous tenant had been her friend Jasper Johns; several years earlier, when Johns had decided to move elsewhere, Susan had taken over the lease. Sadly, though, she didn&#x2019;t think she was going to be allowed to stay; the building&#x2019;s owner wanted that apartment for himself. It was obvious why Susan wanted to keep it: a large, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in a handsome prewar building&#x2014;a terrific bargain at, as I recall, around 475 dollars a month. The enormous living room felt even bigger because there was so little in it (it even echoed slightly). But what she&#x2019;d miss most, she said, was the view: the river, the sunsets. (That great view might have been even better from outdoors, but the terrace was a mess: it was where the dog did its business.) At the other end of the apartment from the two bedrooms was a much smaller room, once a maid&#x2019;s room, with half a bath. At the time, a friend of David&#x2019;s was sleeping there. After I moved in, it would be my study. (&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one in this house with <i>two</i> rooms,&#x201d; Susan would say, hurt, accusing, when I told her that I was leaving &#x201c;340.&#x201d;) </p><p>Over lunch, she asked me a lot of questions about what it was like to work for editors Robert Silvers and Barbara Epstein at <i>The New York Review</i>, and what it was like to study with Elizabeth Hardwick, who&#x2019;d been one of my professors at Barnard and who was also on the editorial board of the <i>Review</i>. It was clear that these three people aroused Susan&#x2019;s keenest interest&#x2014;fascination, even&#x2014;and I would learn that their friendship and approval meant everything to her. All three had been among the <i>Review&#x2019;</i>s founders, in 1963. Susan thought the <i>Review</i> was far superior to any other journal in the country&#x2014;a &#x201c;heroic&#x201d; effort to elevate American intellectual life to the highest possible standards&#x2014;and she was proud to have been writing for it from its very first issue. Her essays were edited by Silvers: &#x201c;By far the best editor I&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d; The best editor any writer <i>could</i> have, she would say. Like other contributors to the <i>Review</i>, she was awed by the grave respect he had for writers, by his perfectionism, and by the intense labor he put into revising articles for publication. He was one of the most intelligent and gifted persons she had ever met, she said&#x2014;and probably the hardest-working, almost always to be found at his desk, seven days a week, including holidays, all day long and usually well into the night. His was precisely the kind of discipline and intellectual passion and scrupulosity that Susan admired most in other people, and he inspired in her the same reverence usually inspired in her only by the most serious writers and artists.</p><p>Her pride in writing for <i>The New York Review</i> was matched by her pride in having Farrar, Straus and Giroux as her book publisher. In fact, her longest and most intimate phone conversation that day was with Roger Straus, who, as head of FSG, had published Susan&#x2019;s first book thirteen years before, and who would go on to publish all her other books. It was not unusual for the two of them to talk at least once a day. At that time, Susan had no literary agent, and besides publishing her books, Straus took care of certain kinds of business that a publisher would not normally deal with, such as trying to place her short stories and articles with magazines. But theirs was not just a business relationship; they were old, good friends, they were each other&#x2019;s confidants, and Straus was involved in many aspects of Susan&#x2019;s nonwriting life, including the crisis of her illness and, when the time came, her search for a new apartment. Although David was already ten years old when Susan and Straus first met, Straus often referred to him as &#x201c;probably my illegitimate son.&#x201d; Soon he would take David into the company, making him the editor of, among other authors, Susan herself. </p><p>The soup was not enough. She searched the fridge, which was mostly bare, but though it was not the season for corn there was a plastic-wrapped package of cobs. After we&#x2019;d eaten the corn, she said, &#x201c;Of course, I didn&#x2019;t want any of that. All I really wanted was a cigarette.&#x201d; I had just recently quit smoking myself, but once I moved in I would start up again. All three of us smoked, as did pretty much everyone who ever came to that apartment.</p><p>By the time I left that day, the sun was low over the Hudson but we&#x2019;d accomplished very little. Susan asked me to come back in a few days. I remember thinking as I walked home how laid-back and open she&#x2019;d been&#x2014;much more like someone my own age than someone of my mother&#x2019;s generation. But she was always this way with young people, and there wasn&#x2019;t the usual generational distance between her and her son, either; her son, whom she&#x2019;d started treating like an adult before he even reached high school, without ever appearing to doubt that this was how things should be. When I think of this now, I can&#x2019;t help thinking also of something Susan said often: how she remembered childhood as a time of complete boredom, and how she could not wait for it to be over. I have always had trouble understanding this (how could anyone&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;even a less than happy one&#x2014;be described as &#x201c;a total waste&#x201d;?), but she had wanted David&#x2019;s childhood to be over as quickly as possible, too. (And as it turned out, he too would look back on his childhood as a miserable time, using the very phrase Susan often used in describing her own: a prison sentence.) It was as if somehow she didn&#x2019;t really believe&#x2014;or, perhaps, better to say, she saw no <i>value</i>&#x2014;in childhood.</p><p></p></p><h2>Million Dollar Habits: Proven Power Practices to Double and Triple Your Income</h2><p><p><b>Proven methods to develop moneymaking habits, from America&#x2019;s foremost business guru</b></p> <p>Million Dollar Habits shows readers how to double or triple their income, increase health and vitality, sustain loving relationships, build financial independence, take a leadership role, and turn visions into reality just by adopting the book&#x2019;s proven habits.</p></p><p><p><b>Change Your Habits...Change Your Life!</b></p> <p>Are you willing to alter the course of your life to accomplish your deepest desires?

Tour.</p><p>Debates concerning the historical and moral significance of Adolf Hitler have gone on since the beginning of his rise to power in Germany. In the decades after his bunker suicide, those debates elevated to arguments over the very nature and existence of evil. An integral part of the arguments has been the ongoing attempt to understand the <i>why</i> of Hitler. In this engaging work of literary journalism, Ron Rosenbaum travels the world to converse with some of the historians, philosophers, filmmakers, and others who have attempted to make sense of Hitler's actions, to find a root cause for the Holocaust.<p> Rosenbaum methodically examines the evidence for and against all the major hypotheses concerning the origin of Hitler's character. He sifts through all the rumors--including his alleged Jewish ancestry and what biographer Alan Bullock refers to as "the one-ball business"--and the attempts to derive some psychological cause from them. Various Hitlers emerge: Hitler as con man and brutal gangster, Hitler the unspeakable pervert, Hitler the ladies' man, Hitler as modernist artist working in the medium of evil....</p><p> But Rosenbaum's portrayals of those who would define Hitler are as fascinating as the shifting perspectives on the f�hrer. Here we see the brave journalists of the <i>Munich Post</i> who attempted to reveal Hitler's evil to the world as early as the 1920s. We witness <i>Shoah</i> director Claude Lanzmann's imperious attempts to stifle analysis of Hitler and the Holocaust, branding such historical inquiries as "obscene." We see the effects, on a frazzled Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, of the controversy surrounding the publication of his <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners</i>. We see the interior crises of Hitler apologist David Irving and philosopher-novelist George Steiner, among others, as they struggle with the ramifications of their work and thought. And, best of all, we have Rosenbaum to serve as an informed, intimate, and on occasion witty guide. In <i>White Noise</i>, Don DeLillo depicted the satirical academic discipline of "Hitler studies;" Ron Rosenbaum breathes a life into the field that no fiction can match. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><p>Ron Rosenbaum grew up on Long Island, New York.

American art critic Bruce Hainley examines the artist's work as a kind of giant self-portrait. Poet and novelist Dennis Cooper discusses with the artist such unexpected influences as contemporary electronic music. Guardian art critic Adrian Searle looks at the artist's work Untitled, 1993 &#x2013; a ring of plastic cups in a home-made Minimalist tradition. The Artist's Choices are The Dinner Party (1919) by Swiss writer Robert Walser, and the glossary to Info-Psychology (1975&#x2013;76) by Timothy Leary, the cult psychologist who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. Facsimiles of the artist's notebooks and text works are published alongside an important interview by curator Robert Storr.</p><p>Bruce Hainley is a Los Angeles-based art critic and contributing editor to Artforum, Spin and Frieze.

But painting them is not the easiest task for an artist, so here is a book filled with useful advice.</p> <p></p> <p>Just as in Terry Harrison's Watercolour Flowers (also reviewed on this site) this book assumes that you are already some type of painter (although possibly not exactly expert) rather than a complete beginner. There are other books for that, and Search Press publishes quite a few. What the book does not assume is that you are proficient at painting seascapes, and helpfully gives an ideal palette of colors to buy, some useful mixes and, even better, some brush techniques for painting things like waves or clouds and the brushes you need for this type of work. This is very helpful - much more so than being told to always buy the best paints. Student colors are fine if you are only a relative beginner, and for practising. Most if not all of the items listed all artists will own, and most of the book is devoted to learning the various elements of seascape composition, practising them in staged projects and then going on to the whole paintings. It is always so helpful and illuminating to look at art this way, and I can see why generations of Chinese painters learned by copying masterpieces before they tried their own compositions. With a book like this, your first seascape doesn't have to be in front of you in reality in order to start. A very useful primer.</p>, <i>Myshelf.com</i><br><br><p>Sept 07</p> <p>Terry begins by a brief overview of materials and colours &#x2013; again he also says buy the best quality paints and papers. He outlines the colours he uses and shows which to mix to make some good sea colours. </p> <p>Terry has his own range of brushes on sale and I found it useful that he showed the makes each one can create.</p> <p></p> <p>The painting section begins by explaining &#x2013; with pictures- basic watercolour techniques such as wet in wet and lifting out, then moves on to a useful section on how to paint different seas, from calm water to crashing waves, and goes on to cover many of the elements for creating sea paintings, such as rocks, reflections and shorelines in separate detail. I found this very useful as it allows any combination of sea paintings to be created, and the instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The latter section of the book contains three demos, using many of the techniques already demonstrated and each one is very clear about what step, colour and brush to use next.</p> <p></p> <p>An excellent soft back book for those interested in creating sea and sky paintings in watercolour, with clear easy to follow instructions.</p>, <i>JeannieZelos.com</i><br><br><p>May 07</p> <p>Terry Harrison&#x2019;s rather excellent little series on the various elements of landscape painting is beginning to resemble a partwork and you can&#x2019;t help wondering when the publisher is going to stick them all together in one volume and call it &#x201c;Terry Harrison&#x2019;s Complete Guide to Landscape Painting&#x201d;. I know I would. That said, there&#x2019;s no reason to hold off and not buy the individual volumes as they appear and if they appeal. If any one of the subjects isn&#x2019;t for you, well then, that&#x2019;s 48 pages you haven&#x2019;t bought unnecessarily.</p> <p></p> <p>Truth to tell, Terry probably isn&#x2019;t the greatest painter in the world and I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s likely that, in a hundred years&#x2019; time, galleries will be competing to buy examples of his work. That, however, isn&#x2019;t to belittle him in any way, because it&#x2019;s not what he sets out to be. Terry is, in very many ways, a born teacher (and the people whose work will be on those gallery walls will probably have taught you nothing during the lifetimes) and he&#x2019;s also a very generous one, holding back very little from the reader. Like his other books, this one is filled with step-by-step demonstrations that show you exactly how to paint rocks, boats, waves, clouds and more in all the detail you could possibly want. If you have trouble painting boats that look as though they actually sit in the water and aren&#x2019;t floating health-hazards, this book is worth it&#x2019;s modest cover price for that alone.</p> <p></p> <p>I intimated that Terry has his drawbacks and there are one or two completed paintings where, frankly, I think the perspective is a bit suspect. I&#x2019;m not sure that the publisher should have let him get away with a whole page illustration where the sea is running downhill towards the shore. Maybe it&#x2019;s a minor niggle, because the demonstration itself is fully up to standard and has all the usual helpful details. It&#x2019;s just that, if it grates, well . . . it grates and might detract from the rest of the book, which is a pity.</p> <p></p> <p>Overall, a worthwhile purchase that will tell you a lot for your money and increase your knowledge not inconsiderably.</p>, <i>Artbookreview.net</i><p>Terry Harrison grew up in Norfolk, UK. His early art education was basic and he never dreamed that he would one day become an artist. At fifteen, Terry moved to Hampshire and, inspired by his brilliant art teacher, won a place at Farnham Art School at the age of sixteen. After graduating he became a graphic artist but continued to paint in his spare time. In 1984 Terry gave up his job to paint full time and never looked back, teaching and demonstrating his watercolour techniques throughout the world, developing his own range of brushes and paints and writing over 20 best-selling books that have been translated into many languages. Sadly, Terry passed away in 2017 but his legacy lives on. His gift for explaining his methods in an easy and accessible way has encouraged countless people to take up painting, and his beautiful works of art, inspired by the English countryside that he loved, will continue to be enjoyed by people all over the world.</p></p><h2>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol. 5: Fantastic Three</h2><p>When the Silver Surfer comes to Manhattan with a warning about an ancient cosmic menace on a collision course with Earth, you better listen up!

With this sobering statistic, physician and researcher Siddhartha Mukherjee begins his comprehensive and eloquent "biography" of one of the most virulent diseases of our time. An exhaustive account of cancer's origins, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> illustrates how modern treatments--multi-pronged chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, as well as preventative care--came into existence thanks to a century's worth of research, trials, and small, essential breakthroughs around the globe. While <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> is rich with the science and history behind the fight against cancer, it is also a meditation on illness, medical ethics, and the complex, intertwining lives of doctors and patients. Mukherjee's profound compassion--for cancer patients, their families, as well as the oncologists who, all too often, can offer little hope--makes this book a very human history of an elusive and complicated disease. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br>Siddhartha Mukherjee M.D., Ph.D., is a cancer physician and researcher.
